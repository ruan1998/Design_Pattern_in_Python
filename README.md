## [[Creational Patterns]]
- deal with the creation(construction) of objects
- **explicit**(constructor) vs. **implicit**(DI, reflection, etc.)
- wholesale(single statement) vs. piecewise(step by step)

- many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
- stress the importance of good API design

- No central theme
- solve particular problem
- solve in particular way
- behave particular set of concern
