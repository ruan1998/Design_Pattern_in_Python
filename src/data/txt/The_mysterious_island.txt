Book 1 Chapter 1
"Are we rising again?" "No. On the contrary." "Are we descending?" "Worse than that, captain! we are falling!" "For Heaven's sake heave out the ballast!" "There! the last sack is empty!" "Does the balloon rise?" "No!" "I hear a noise like the dashing of waves. The sea is below the car! It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!" "Overboard with every weight! . . . everything!"
Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air, above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of March, 1865.
Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast, in the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.
But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.
In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.
Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.
Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From what part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started during the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the first symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that the balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.
At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance, could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the very midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were removed from a horizontal position.
Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring of the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while suspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However, the balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.
The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March, it showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It was still what sailors call "a close-reefed topsail breeze," but the commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.
Towards eleven o'clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone farther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have passed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons of the Indian Ocean?
But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were, little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.
Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept, everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.
It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions. They must infallibly perish!
There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them. The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid surface upon which their anchor could hold.
It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm, appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not a solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in the waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work. But, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.
Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas escaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet of the ocean.
It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which it contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension in the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only be retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.
They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single murmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the last minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.
Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the water.
At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not less determined. "Is everything thrown out?" "No, here are still 2,000 dollars in gold." A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. "Does the balloon rise?" "A little, but it will not be long before it falls again." "What still remains to be thrown out?" "Nothing." "Yes! the car!" "Let us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car."
This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon. The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall, mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.
The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical position. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical precision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So it happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent which it was impossible to repair.
The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them now.
They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.
At four o'clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the water.
A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.
"Top has seen something," cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud voice shouted,--
"Land! land!" The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in fact, appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles off. It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there was the chance of falling to leeward.
An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet retained?
Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that solid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what it was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what part of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach this land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.
It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose, like a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in great folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to the net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the sea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out again, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it not possibly thus reach the land?
But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs of lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck by a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new part of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it met a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast, carried it in a nearly parallel direction.
At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on a sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.
The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from the meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken by the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant, disappeared into space.
But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon only left four on the shore.
The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had just struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the land. Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they all, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, "Perhaps he will try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us save him!"
“我们又在上升了吗？”“不，正相反！我们在下降！”“比那还要糟，史密斯先生！我们正在往下掉！”“天哪！快把压仓物扔出去吧！”“瞧！这最后的一袋都空了！”“气球上升了吗？”“没有！”“我好象听到波浪冲击的声音！”“吊篮下面就是海！”“离我们至多不过五百英尺了！”“把所有占分量的东西都扔下去！……所有的东西！”
这就是1865年3月23日下午四点钟从辽阔的太平洋上空传来的喊声。
那年春分前后，那场从东北方吹来的骇人暴风是令人难忘的。从3月18日到26日，大风暴片刻不停地怒吼着。它从北纬35度斜穿赤道，直到南纬40度，掠过了一千八百英里的地带，给美洲、欧洲和亚洲造成了严重的灾害。城市被吹毁；树木被连根拨起；排山倒海似的巨浪冲毁了堤岸，仅仅根据已经发表的数字，一直抛上陆地的船就有几百只；有些龙卷风经过的地方，整个都变成了平地；好几千人在陆上和海里丧了命；这就是当时疯狂肆虐的暴风过去以后所留下的罪证。1810年10月25日哈瓦那和1825年7月26日瓜德罗普的灾情固然可怕，但是也比不上这一次。
就在这陆地和海洋上惨遭浩劫的时候，激荡的高空中也演出了同样惊心动魄的悲剧。
一只轻气球，象被龙卷风带到水柱顶上的皮球一样，卷进了一股气流的旋涡中，它以每小时九十英里的速度掠过太空，仿佛被什么空中旋涡抓住了似的，不停地转着。
气球的下边系着一只吊篮，里面坐着五个人，由于浓雾和水汽弥漫在整个的洋面上，人们很难看得清楚。
也许有人会问，这个气球——暴风的玩具是从哪儿来的？它是从地球的哪个角落升起的？当然，它是不会在刮暴风的时候起飞的。但是，暴风已经刮了五天，并且在18日那天就已经有了要起风暴的征兆。毫无疑问，这个气球是从极远的地方飞来的，因为大风一昼夜至少要把它带走两千英里。
这些迷失方向的乘客，横竖也没法计算他们起航以来经历了多少路程。奇怪的是，他们虽然在这怒吼的暴风中飘荡，却还是平安无事。他们被风抛来抛去，吹得团团乱转，却丝毫不觉得自己在滚动，也不觉得怎样颠簸。
他们的目光没法透过吊篮下面的浓雾。阴云环抱着他们。他们分辨不清是白天还是黑夜。当时他们悬浮在高空中，周围一片昏暗，既看不见地上的反光，也听不到地上的人声，连海洋的澎湃声也传不到他们的耳朵里。只有当急骤下降的时候，他们才意识到会有惨遭灭顶的危险。他们扔下了弹药、枪枝和粮食一些重负以后，便又升到四千五百英尺高度的空中。飞行的人们一发觉下面是汪洋大海，就觉得上面的危险总比下面小些，因此毫不犹豫地连他们最有用的东西都扔掉了，同时他们尽量想法不让气球漏掉一点氢气，只有这种氢气，才是他们的命根子，才能把他们悬在海洋上。
黑夜在惊险恐怖中过去了（如果是胆小的人，恐怕早已吓死了）。白昼又来临了。随着白昼的来临，暴风也逐渐和缓下来。从3月24日那一天清晨起，暴风有了减弱的征象。黎明时分，一片片的轻云向更高处升去。几小时的工夫，飓风已经变成了“强风”，这就是说：大气流动的速度已经减弱了一半。这时虽然还是水手们所说的“紧帆风”，然而风势毕竟减弱不少了。
将近十一点钟的时候，下层的空气显得比较明朗了。大气已经发出象雷雨过后常有的那种湿润的气息。暴风似乎不再向西刮了。风力已经显得有气无力了。它会不会象印度洋上的台风那样，往往说停就停，一下子就烟消云散呢？
可是，就在这时候，气球显然又在慢慢地下降了。看来它正在逐渐瘪下去，气囊愈伸愈长，从球形变成了椭圆形。到了中午，气球离海面只有两千英尺了。气囊能容纳五万立方英尺气体，正因为它有这么大容量，所以它才能在空中——或是向上升得很高，或是保持平行方向移动——停留很长时间。
乘客们感觉到自己有危险，把仅存的一些能够使吊篮下坠的物品：少量存粮，每一件东西，甚至衣袋里的小刀都扔掉了。这时，有一个人爬到套住网索的圆环上，打算把气球的下部系得更牢一些。
然而，乘客们心里都很明白，氢气已经不足了，气球不可能再维持在更高的空际。他们只有死路一条了。
他们底下没有大陆，甚至连一个小岛也没有。只是一片汪洋，没有一处可以让他们着陆、也没有任何地面可以让他们下锚。
辽阔的大海上，仍然翻腾着惊涛骇浪！这片汪洋大海，即使人们居高临下，视野扩大到半径四十英里，也同样是一眼望不到边。这流动的平原在暴风无情的鞭挞下激起汹涌的浪头，真好比万马奔腾，那一片白色鬃毛还在迎风飘拂哩！看不到一寸陆地，也看不到一叶孤帆！这时必须不借任何代价阻止气球再往下降，否则就有被波浪吞没的危险。乘客们在这紧急关头显然是尽了最大的努力。但是，尽管他们努力，气球还是继续下坠，同时顺着东北风以极大速度移动。
这些不幸的人们所处的境况的确是惊险万分！他们已经不是气球的主人了。他们的一切努力都没有用。气球的气囊愈来愈瘪。氢气不住地往外泄，没有任何办法可以堵塞。下降的速度显然愈过愈快，午后一点钟，吊篮离洋面已经不到六百英尺了。
氢气从气囊的一条裂缝在外冲，要阻止它往外冲是不可能的了。吊篮里的东西都扔掉了，重量轻了，因此，几个钟头以内，乘客们还可以在空中支持下去，不至于掉下来。但这仅仅是苟延残喘而已，如果在天黑以前还找不到陆地，那么乘客、吊篮和气球肯定地都要葬身海底了。
这时候，他们拿出了最后的一着。他们显然都是勇敢无畏、头脑冷静的人。他们没有一句怨言。他们尽量想办法延迟降落的时刻，他们决心要奋斗到最后一分钟。吊篮不过是个柳条编的篮子，不能在水上漂浮，万一落到海里，决没有任何可能不沉下去。
两点钟的时候，气球离水面仅仅四百英尺了。这时候，突然听到一声洪亮的声音，从这声音就知道这人一点也没想到恐惧。回答他的声音也同样显得坚强有力。“东西都扔了吗？”“不，还有一万金法郎。”一个沉重的钱袋立刻落到海里。“气球上升了吗？”“上升了一点儿，但是一会儿又会下降的。”“还有什么可扔的吗？”“没有了。”“有！……吊蓝！”“让我们抓住网索，把吊篮扔到海里去吧！”
这的确是最后的唯一可以减轻气球重量的方法了。系着吊篮的绳索割断了，吊篮掉了下去，于是，气球又上升了两千英尺。
这五位乘客爬上了气球网，紧紧攀住网眼，注视着下面的无底深渊。
大家知道气球对于重力的增减是最敏感的。即使扔下很轻的东西，也可以改变它的高度。这种在空气中浮动的工具象一架极度精确的天平。不难想象，它只要减轻一点点负担，马上就会急剧上升。这时的情形正是这样。但是，没一会儿工夫，气球又开始下降了，气体从裂缝中向外跑，这裂缝现在要补也没法补。
这些人尽了最大的努力。现在人力已经不能挽救他们，只好听天由命了。
在四点钟的时候，气球离海面只剩五百英尺了。
传来一声响亮的犬吠声。原来飞航员们还带着一只狗！它紧紧地靠着它的主人攀在网眼上。
“托普瞧见什么了？”一个人大声说。接着马上有人喊道：
“陆地！陆地！”
原来气球从天亮到现在，随着大风向西南飘行了足足有几百英里。现在前面出现了一片相当高的陆地。不过这片陆地还在三十英里以外。如果一直飘去的话，至少也要一个钟头才能到那里。
一个钟头！在这一个钟头里气球里仅存的一点气体会不会全跑光呢？
问题的严重性就在这里！飞航员已经清清楚楚地望见了陆地，他们必须不借任何代价到达那里。他们并不知道那是什么地方，是岛屿还是大陆，因为他们不知道飓风把他们吹到地球的哪一个角落来了。但是，他们只好到那块陆地去，不管那里有没有人，去得去不得。
气球在四点钟的时候，就已经支持不下去，现在它更贴近水面了！巨大的浪花好几次舔着网的下部，使它更加沉重，气球象一只翅膀受了伤的鸟，要飞又飞不高。半小时后，距陆地只有一英里了，但是气球已经耗尽了气力，褶绉不堪地悬在那里，只有上层还剩下一些气体。飞航员们紧紧地攀住气球网，可是还嫌太重，不久，他们有半个身子浸在海里了，汹涌的波浪冲击着他们。又过了一会，气球的气囊变成了一个口袋，风象吹着帆片似的使它往前飘过去。它也许能就这样到达陆地吧！
但是，当离岸只有两锚链远的时候，四个人同时惊叫起来。那只原以为决不能再飞的气球，在一个巨浪的打击下，竟突然出人意料地一下子升起来。一会儿工夫，它似乎又减轻了一部分重量，高升到一千五百英尺的上空，在那里它遇到一阵风，这阵风并没有把它吹上岸，反而吹得它沿着和陆地几乎平行的方向飞去了。
两分钟以后，它终于又斜转回来，最后降落在一个波涛冲击不到的沙滩上。飞航员们彼此协助从网眼里脱出身来。气球由于失去了人们的重量，又被风吹起来，象一只受伤的鸟，精神一恢复，便消失在空中了。
吊篮里原来有五个人和一只狗，可是现在随气球着陆的却只剩下四个人了。
失踪的那一个人一定是浪涛冲击气球网的时候被卷到海里去了，正因为这样，气球才减轻了重量，才会在着陆前不久突然一下子上升。这四个遇险的人脚一踏上了陆地，就发觉少了一个伙伴，马上同声喊道，“大概他会游上岸来的。我们要救他！我们要救他！”
Book 1 Chapter 2
Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither aeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose boldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.
A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But Heaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the 20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the capital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South, during the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted five days.
The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were as follows:
That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups de main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess himself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the enemy and were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was Captain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class engineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the direction of the railways, which were so important at that time. A true Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his close-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache, were already getting gray. He had one-of those finely-developed heads which appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious mouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was one of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe, like generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he also possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited remarkable proofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he did was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament. Learned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all emergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human success--activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will. He might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th century: "I can undertake and persevere even without hope of success." Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in all the battles of that war. After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who said, "I never count my dead!" And hundreds of times Captain Harding had almost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but in these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till the moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle near Richmond. At the same time and on the same day another important personage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than Gideon Spilen, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.
Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain exact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest possible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald, are genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with. Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, "reporting" among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.
He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble. He did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who speak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short, decisive, and clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he was not wanting in humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black River, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the telegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result of the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the Bible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New York Herald published the first intelligence.
Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age. Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady, lively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take in at a glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to all climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.
For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York Herald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as skilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured, he was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The last words in his note-book were these: "A Southern rifleman has just taken aim at me, but--" The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon Spilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a scratch.
Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except by reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer's wounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made acquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate each other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping, rejoining Grant's army, and fighting together in the ranks of the Federals.
The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance; but although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town, Richmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted to him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on the engineer's estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus, who was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given his freedom. The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He would have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active, clever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry, obliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered to the familiar abbreviation of Neb.
When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond, and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life twenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding his master, can scarcely be described.
But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite another thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very strictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the attempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did not present itself, but was very difficult to find.
Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of Petersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.
The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active mind was occupied with one sole thought--how he might get out of Richmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt, but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant's army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern forces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner. The truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not leave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the Northern army invested it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had been unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to make known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march of the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines, and in that way reach the Secessionist camp.
The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and placed at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five other persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have to defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of their aerial voyage being prolonged.
The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should be effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force, and the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee's camp in a few hours.
But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was evident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became such that Forster's departure was deferred, for it was impossible to risk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious elements.
The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to depart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the impatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.
The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the weather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened to the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.
The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with redoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.
On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an American from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had gone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being with two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished at nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a former captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his own child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust; but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by some means or other. He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On this day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without circumlocution, "Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?"
The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a low voice,--
"Captain Harding, will you try to escape?"
"When?" asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this question was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined the stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating eye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had before him an honest man.
"Who are you?" he asked briefly.
Pencroft made himself known.
"Well," replied Harding, "and in what way do you propose to escape?"
"By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us--"
There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The engineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and dragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his project, which was indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its execution. The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how to manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art of sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft would not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend Herbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the ocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.
Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word, but his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for opportunity--he was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible, though, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night, in spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the car, and then cut the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they might be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without this storm!--Without this storm the balloon would have started already and the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.
"I am not alone!" said Harding at last.
"How many people do you wish to bring with you?" asked the sailor.
"Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb."
"That will be three," replied Pencroft; "and with Herbert and me five. But the balloon will hold six--"
"That will be enough, we will go," answered Harding in a firm voice.
This "we" included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew, was not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him he approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple an idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his master wherever his master wished to go.
"This evening, then," said Pencroft, "we will all meet out there."
"This evening, at ten o'clock," replied Captain Harding; "and Heaven grant that the storm does not abate before our departure."
Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging, where young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the sailor's plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result of the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous elements!
No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.
It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the wind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the nearly- deserted square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same on his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man who did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like his friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening arrived. The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like clouds close to the ground. Rain fell mingled with snow. it was very cold. A mist hung over Richmond. it seemed as if the violent storm had produced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets of the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners, but what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they contemplated in the midst of the furious elements?--
"Dirty weather!" exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head with a blow of his fist; "but pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!"
At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different directions into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the wind, had left in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost beaten to the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of ballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was held by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five prisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived, and such was the darkness that they could not even see each other.
Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer's order detached successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only, and the sailor rejoined his companions.
The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had nothing to do but to give the word.
At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top, a favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his chain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional weight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.
"One more will make but little difference, poor beast!" exclaimed Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after having dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it swept by them.
Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending, and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by fog.
Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest fury by the gale.
Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals who set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of March. Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast, seven thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was missing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the engineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet, they all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him
那几个刚才被飓风抛掷在海岸上的人，根本不是什么气球飞行员——既不是职业的，也不是业余的，而是一群战俘。正因为他们个个英勇，人人豪迈，所以才想出这种异想天开的办法来逃脱。”
他们出生入死已经有几百次了！他们也有数百次几乎从破裂的气球上掉到海洋的深渊。但是不知为什么，上天却别具用心地保全了他们的生命。在3月20日那天，他们逃出了里士满，在空中连续飞行了五天，现在他们离开那弗吉尼亚的首府已经有七千英里了。在可怕的南北战争期间，里士满是南方的要塞，当时正被尤利斯•格兰特将军的部队包围。
战俘们逃跑的经过是这样的：
1865年2月间，格兰特将军打算出奇制胜，占领里士满，可是没有成功，结果他部下的几个军官却落到敌人手里，被囚禁在城内。其中最突出的一个是联邦参谋部的赛勒斯•史密斯。他是马萨诸塞州人，一位渊博的学者，在战争期间，政府曾委派他负责当时在战略上极其重要的铁路的管理工作。他是一位道地的北方人，瘦骨嶙峋的，约有四十五岁，他的短头发和一小撮浓胡子都已经灰白了。他的头部长得非常端正，仿佛生来是为了铸在勋章上似的，两眼炯炯有光，嘴形庄严，从面貌看，他显得是一个激进派的学者。他是一个从舞锤弄斧做起的工程师，正如一个行伍出身的将军一样。他不但脑子灵，而且手也巧。他的筋肉显得非常强壮。他是一个活动家，同时又是一个思想家。他热情乐观，任何一件事都难不倒他。他见多识广，善于随机应变，在任何紧要关头，他都能保持清醒的头脑，无限的信心和坚强的毅力；这三个条件使他永远是他自己的主人。他常常引用十六世纪奥兰治的威廉的话作为自己的座右铭：“即使已经没有成功的希望，我也能够承担任务，坚忍不拔。”
赛勒斯•史密斯就是勇敢的化身。他参加过南北战争的各次战役。他自从在伊利诺斯州自愿投效尤利斯•格兰特麾下以来，曾在巴丢卡、柏尔梦特、匹兹堡埠头等地作战，在围攻科林斯、吉布森港、黑河、差坦诺加、魏尔德涅斯、颇陀马克等地的战役中，始终是勇猛善战，并没有辜负那位说“我决不计算我的伤亡”的将军的训导。史密斯好几百次几乎成为威严的格兰特所不计算的阵亡将士。但是，他在这些战斗中，直到在里士满战场上受伤被俘以前，一直是很幸运地平安无事。就在史密斯被俘的那一天，还有一位重要人物也落到南军手里。这就是《纽约先驱报》的通讯记者吉丁•史佩莱，他是奉命跟随北军作战地报道的。
吉丁•史佩莱在英、美新闻采访员当中，也是一位有名的人物，正象史坦莱等人一样，不管什么困难也不能使他退缩，他也要采访到正确消息，并且在最短时间内把消息送给自己的报刊。联邦的许多报纸，例如《纽约先驱报》，都拥有坚强的实力，报刊的通讯记者就是它们的代表。吉丁•史佩莱又是第一流的记者：他是一位精明强于、体力充沛、办事敏捷、善于开动脑筋的人；他环游过世界各地；他是一个兵士，也是一个艺术家；他在谈话时很热情，行动时很坚决，既不顾虑劳累，也不害怕危险；采访新闻的时候，他首先是为了自己，也是为了他的报刊；凡是新奇的、没有发表过的、别人不知道同时也没法采访到的事物，他全都知道；他是一位浑身是胆的战地记者，惯于在枪林弹雨中写稿，危险，对于他来说，就是最好的报道资料。
他参加过各次战役，每次都在最前线，一手拿着左轮枪，一手拿着笔记簿；葡萄弹从来也没有使他的铅笔颤抖；他决不象有些人没话找话说，而总是不厌其烦地打着电报；他的每一篇报道都很简短有力、明确、能够说明要点。此外，他还很幽默。黑河的战事结束以后，决心不借任何代价独占电报局窗洞的就是他。他在向他的报刊报道了战役的结果以后，接着就拍发圣经的前几章，一共拍了两个钟头之久，虽然花费了两千美元，但《纽约先驱报》却首先登载了这个消息。
吉丁•史佩莱身材高大，大约有四十来岁。淡红色的胡须围绕着他的面庞。眼光坚定活泼，而且变化迅速。只要目光一扫，他就可以把一切景象一览无遗了。他体格健壮，能够适应各种气候，好象一根在冷水中淬硬了的钢筋。
吉丁•史佩莱担任《纽约先驱报》的通讯记者已经有十年了。他不但文笔美妙，并且精于绘画，他的通讯和插图大大充实了报刊的内容，他被俘的时候，还正在描写战役和画素描，他的笔记簿中的最后一句是：“一个南军正拿枪对着我，但是……”然而那个南军的兵士并没有打中吉丁•史佩莱，他一向是幸运的，在这次事件中也没有受一点伤。
赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱过去只是闻其名而没有见过面，他们一起被押送到里士满。工程师的创伤很快就痊愈了，就在他养伤的期间他认识了这位通讯记者。他们一见面就建立了友谊。不久以后，他们产生了一个共同的目的，那就是逃回格兰特的军中，为了联邦的统一而继续战斗。
这两个美国人一开始就想找机会逃跑；虽然他们能够自由地在市镇里溜达，但是里士满戒备严密，逃脱似乎是不可能的。在这期间，史密斯遇到了一个昔日的仆人，他是一个愿意为史密斯竭尽忠诚的人。他是一个勇士，也是一个黑人，是在工程师家里出生的，他的父母都是奴隶。但是，赛勒斯在信仰上和道义上都反对奴隶制，因此早就让他自由了。这个曾经当过奴隶的人，虽然得到了自由，还是不愿意离开他的主人。他情愿为他的主人效死，他大约有三十岁，强壮、活泼、聪明、伶俐、温柔、和顺、有时还有点天真，平时总是一团高兴，勤恳而诚实。他的名字叫做纳布加尼察，但他已经习惯让人们简称他为纳布了。
纳布听到主人被俘的消息，就毫不犹豫地离开了马萨诸塞来到里士满，凭着他的机智，冒了二十多次生命的危险之后，终于潜入了被围的城市。史密斯瞧见纳布时的喜悦和纳布找到主人的高兴，那是难以形容的。
纳布虽然能够进入里士满，但要想再溜出去就完全不同了，因为北军战俘被看守得非常严格。要想顺利地逃跑，除非遇到特别的机会！这种机会不但不会送上门来，而且很难找到。
在这期间，格兰特将军还在继续作战。他以重大的代价赢得了匹兹堡的胜利。然而在里士满战线上，他和巴特莱部队联合进攻还不能取得胜利，因此战俘们想要早日获得释放是没有什么希望的。
在这枯燥无味的囚禁生活中，没有一点值得记述的事情，通讯记者再也不能忍耐了。他那一向灵活的头脑只想着一件事——怎样能够不借任何代价逃出里士满。他甚至尝试了几次，但都被不能克服的障碍阻挡住了。围困还在继续着！如果说战俘急切要逃回格兰特的军中，那末，被围的人也迫切希望和南军取得联系，其中约拿旦•福斯特就是南军中的一个热切希望如此的人。被俘的北军固然不能出城，而南军也同样离开不了，因为他们都给北军包围了。里士满的总督很久没能和李将军取得联系了，他很想把当地的情况告诉李将军，以便迅速得到援兵。于是约拿旦•福斯特就建议利用轻气球越过包围线，直达南军的兵营。
总督批准了这个计划。造了一只轻气球供福斯特使用，另外还派了五个人做他的动手。他们携带了降落时自卫用的武器，并准备了干粮，以备航程拖延时食用。
气球预计在3月18日启航。起飞必须在夜间进行，还要有和缓的西北风。据飞行员的估计，他们在几个钟头之内就可以到达李将军的军营了。
但是，刮的却不是什么和缓的西北风。从18日起它分明已经变成飓风了。风暴很快就猛烈起来，福斯特只好延期动身，因为乘客和气球是不能在这种险恶的天气里冒险的。
轻气球灌足了气，放在里士满的一个广场上，只等风势稍弱，就要启航。困守在城里的人盼望着暴风缓和的心情是不难想象的。
3月18、19两天过去了，天气并没有什么转变。拴在地上的气球被狂风猛烈地冲过来撞过去，甚至要保护这个气球都很困难。
19日的夜晚过去了。第二天早上暴风加倍猛烈，气球更不可能起飞了。
那天，工程师赛勒斯•史密斯在里士满的一条大街上，被一个素不相识的人喊住了。这是一个水手，名叫潘克洛夫，年纪大约三十五岁到四十岁，体格强壮，皮肤晒得黝黑。长着一对炯炯发光的眼睛和非常英俊的面庞。潘克洛夫是一个美国的北方人，他航遍了各大洋，参加过一切可能和几乎不可能的探险，一切不长翅膀只长腿的生物所能碰到的遭遇他都遇到过了。可想而知，他是一个大胆而勇猛的家伙，敢作敢为，什么也吓不倒他。年初的时候，潘克洛夫有事到里士满来，他带着一个新泽西的男孩子，这是过去一个船长的孤儿，才十五岁，潘克洛夫象对待亲生子女似的爱护他。在围城以前，他没有能离开这座城市，等到发觉自己被围在城里的时候，感到十分懊丧。但是他从来不肯向困难低头，因此他决定要想法子逃出去。他听说过这位工程师军官的大名，他了解这位坚强的男子汉在囚禁中的苦闷。因此，这一天他毫不犹豫，直截了当地向工程师招呼道：“史密斯先生，你在里士满待够了吗？”
工程师呆呆地看着对他说话的人，对方又低声补充了一句：
“先生，你打算逃跑吗？”
“什么时候？”工程师连忙问道，这句话显然是脱口而出的，因为他还没有看清楚这个跟他说话的陌生人是谁。但是当他用敏锐的眼光打量了一下水手爽朗的面孔之后，他就确信对方是一个诚实的人。
“你是谁？”他简短地问道。
潘克洛夫作了自我介绍。
“好吧，”史密斯回答说，“你打算用什么法子逃呢？”
“用那只气球，它在那里什么也不干，我看它正是为我们预备的……”
水手的话没有说完，工程师就明白他的意思了。他抓住潘克洛夫的胳膊，把他拉到自己住的地方去。在那里，这位水手说出了他的计划。计划倒是十分简单，除了生命危险以外，什么危险也用不着冒。当然，飓风的威力正大，但是，象赛勒斯•史密斯这样精明强干的工程师是完全懂得怎样操纵气球的。假如潘克洛夫对飞行技术，正好象对航海一样熟悉，那么他一定早就毫不犹豫地带着他的小朋友赫伯特出发了；他惯于在海里冒狂风骇浪的危险，这场飓风是难不住他的。
史密斯一言不发地倾听着水手的讲话，他的眼中闪耀着满意的光芒。想望已久的机会终于来到了——他决不是坐失良机的人。这个计划是可以实行的，但必须承认，非常危险。夜间虽然有岗哨，他们还可能走近气球，潜入吊篮，然后割断系住吊篮的绳索。当然，他们可能被打死，但另一方面，他们也有成功的希望。要是没有这场风暴多好啊！——不过话要说回来，要是没有这场风暴，气球早已启航了，这个千载难逢的机会也就不会出现了。
“我不只是一个人！”史密斯最后说。
“你要带几个人？”水手问道。
“两个人。我的朋友史佩莱，还有我的仆人纳布。”
“那就是三个人，”潘克洛夫说，“连赫伯特和我一共是五个人。气球能载六个……”
“那就行了，我们一定走。”史密斯坚决地说。
这个“我们”包括史佩莱在内，因为史密斯非常了解，这位通讯记者不是胆小如鼠的人。史佩莱听到这个计划以后，表示完全同意。使他惊奇的是：这么简单的办法自己以前竟没有想到。至于纳布，他是到处追随着他的主人的。
“那么，今天晚上，”潘克洛夫说，“大家都到那里集合。”
“今天晚上十点钟，”史密斯回答说，“但愿上天保佑，在我们离开以前，风势不要减弱。”
潘克洛夫辞别了工程师，回他的寓所去了。年轻的赫伯特•布朗还独自留在那里。这个勇敢的少年知道水手的计划，焦急地盼望着向工程师提议的结果。这五个意志坚决的人就这样打算在暴风雨中碰碰运气了！
没有！风势并没有减退，约拿旦•福斯特和他的伙伴们都不愿意在不保险的吊篮里任凭风吹雨打。
这一天是不好过的。工程师只担心一件事，担心那系在地面上的气球在大风猛烈的撞击下可能被撕成碎片。他在几乎空旷无人的广场上来回踱了几个钟头，看着这个飞行工具。潘克洛夫也采取了同样的行动，他双手插在衣袋里，好象设法消磨时间似的，不时打着呵欠，但是实际上也象他的朋友那样，十分担心气球会不会损坏，风会不会刮断它的绳索，把它刮到天空去。天晚了。夜色非常昏暗。大雾象乌云一般弥漫在地面上。天空同时下着雨和雪。气候非常寒冷。浓雾笼罩着里士满。强烈的风暴似乎在攻和守的双方之间造成了休战状态，大炮的声音在怒吼的狂风中一点也听不到了。城市的街道上不见人影，在这么恶劣的天气里，官方似乎没有想到会丢失气球，因此觉得没有必要在广场上设岗。这一切都是俘虏们脱逃的有利条件，但是，他们在狂风暴雨中所作的冒险尝试最后会怎么样呢？
“天气真坏！”潘克洛夫喊道，他一拳压住了头上那顶要被风刮走的帽子。“但是，啊，我们还是会成功的！”
九点半钟，史密斯和他的伙伴们从不同的方向来到广场，大风吹灭了汽灯，广场上一片漆黑。连那几乎被吹倒在地上的大气球也看不见了。网索是系在沙囊上的，而吊篮却是单独用一根结实的钢缆穿在便道的一个铁环里。五个俘虏在吊篮旁边会合了。他们没有被人发现，由于天色昏黑，甚至他们彼此都看不见。
史密斯、史佩莱、纳布和赫伯特一言不发地在吊篮里各自坐了下来，潘克洛夫按照工程师的指示把沙囊一一解开。只花了几分钟的工夫，水手就回到他的伙伴们身边来了。
系着气球的只剩下一根钢缆，只要工程师一声号令就可以起飞了。
就在这时候，突然有一只狗跳到吊篮里来。原来是工程师的爱犬托普。这只忠实的畜生挣断链索，赶上了它的主人。工程师怕这份外加的重量会影响他们的上升，想打发它走。
“可怜的畜生！就多它一个吧！”潘克洛夫一面说，一面把两袋沙土扔了出去，减轻了吊篮的重量，然后解开钢缆，气球斜着往上升去，由于起势猛烈，吊篮在两个烟囱上碰了一下，然后才消失得无影无踪。
飓风可怕地怒吼着。在夜间下降，工程师连想也不敢想；拂晓时，下面的大地被浓雾遮蔽得一点也看不见。
五天以后他们才从云隙中看到下面的一片汪洋大海。在飓风的推送下，气球以惊人的速度飞行着。
大家都知道：在3月20日起飞的这五个人，后来在3月24日有四个人被抛弃在远离祖国六千英里的荒凉海岸上，一个人丢失了！这个丢失的人就是他们的领袖，工程师史密斯！他们刚刚着陆，就连忙赶到海滩上去，打算援救他。
Book 1 Chapter 3
The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried off by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal had voluntarily leaped out to help his master. "Forward," cried the reporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting their fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on earth.
Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared to the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes therefore of arriving in time to save him. "Let us look for him! let us look for him!" cried Neb.
"Yes, Neb," replied Gideon Spilett, "and we will find him too!"
"Living, I trust!"
"Still living!"
"Can he swim?" asked Pencroft.
"Yes," replied Neb, "and besides, Top is there."
The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.
The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half a mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.
It was then nearly six o'clock. A thick fog made the night very dark. The castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they could not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground, very unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes, making walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose above the roaring of the sea.
From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to give any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of the shore.
After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly brought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to their feet. The solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the extremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously.
"It is a promontory," said the sailor; "we must retrace our steps, holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland."
"But if he is there," said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone of a snowy white in the darkness. "Well, let us call again," and all uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no reply. They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.
The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the mist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea was also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the waves was diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This side of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the sharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow this direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the coast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to the north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must be attached to the mainland. The castaways, although their strength was nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every moment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first direction. What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly two miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks, they found themselves again stopped by the sea.
"We are on an islet," said Pencroft, "and we have surveyed it from one extremity to the other."
The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not even on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in length, with even a less breadth.
Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with stones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important archipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car saw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter it sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated coast. But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single island, or connected with others. They could not leave it either, as the sea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their search for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached them to show that he was still in existence.
"The silence of our friend proves nothing," said the reporter. "Perhaps he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will not despair."
The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet, which would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain for wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found. The grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too evident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what patience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast, or he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived it. They did not even think of taking a minute's rest. Forgetting everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its northern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the catastrophe. They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices, they endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would be transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to a calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb's shouts even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft's attention to it, adding, "That proves that there is a coast to the west, at no great distance." The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not deceive him. If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might appear, land was sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only response produced by Neb's shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the part east of the island.
Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions he would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern Hemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not those which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.
The night passed away. Towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark, but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At length the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.
It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish nothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast upon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast in the west. But not a speck of land was visible. "Never mind," said Pencroft, "though I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there... there... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond." But the fog was not long in rising. it was only a fine-weather mist. A hot sun soon penetrated to the surface of the island. About half-past six, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more transparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the isle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed itself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on the west by an abrupt and precipitous coast.
Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally insured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half a mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.
However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart, immediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his companions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste to be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. "Do you want to cross the channel?" he asked. "Yes," replied Spilett. "All right!" said the seaman; "wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we venture into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by the current, which is running very strong; but, if I'm not wrong, it is ebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience, and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage." "You are right," replied the reporter, "we will not separate more than we can help."
During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He was crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen emerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also made way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from the islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet from the place which was opposite to the point from which he had started.
Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind a rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern extremity of the islet.
Neb's companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety, and when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land where their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which the sand was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better than nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the south by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation, and was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a grotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the contrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending from the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape. The distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the bay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet, which somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme breadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.
Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with black stones, which were now appearing little by little above the retreating tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending suddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the hand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and jagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it mingled with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of the coast not a tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above Cape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least so it appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to the right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a confused mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view. This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white summit which reflected the sun's rays. It was that of a lofty mountain, capped with snow.
The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed an island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding the convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have hesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably the work of subterranean convulsions.
Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed they might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as was likely to be the case.
"Well," asked Herbert, "what do you say, Pencroft?"
"There is some good and some bad, as in everything," replied the sailor. "We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we will attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get out of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain." Pencroft was not wrong in his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between the islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would no doubt be easy to cross.
About ten o'clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and then ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep. Herbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through capitally. All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore. Quickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which they had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take counsel together what to do next.
工程师从网眼上掉下来以后，就被海浪卷走了。吊篮里的狗也失踪了。这只忠实的狗主动地跳出去营救它的主人。“前进啊！”通讯记者喊道；他们四个人——史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布——全都忘记了疲倦，到处寻找。可怜的纳布痛哭流涕，一想到世界上自己唯一心爱的人已经丧命，他不禁感到灰心。
从赛勒斯•史密斯失踪到他的伙伴们着陆，前后只有两分钟。因此他们希望能及时赶去救他。纳布喊道：“我们去找他吧！我们去找他吧！”
“对，纳布，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我们一定找得到他！”
“他还活着吗？”
“一定活着！”
“他会游泳吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“会的，”纳布答道，“还有托普跟他在一起呢。”
水手望着拍岸的巨浪，不禁摇摇头。
工程师是在海滨的北部失踪的，离这群遇难人着陆的地点将近半英里。因此，也就是说，他离最近的海岸足有半英里。
这时候将近六点钟了。暮色在浓雾的笼罩下，显得格外昏暗。遇难的人从他们偶然落下的地方向北面一片陌生的地区走去，那里的地理位置他们简直无从猜测。他们在寸草不生的沙地上跋涉着。地面坎坷不平，有些地方完全是坑洞，走起来非常困难。不时有许多不善飞翔的大鸟从这些坑洞里向各处飞去。比较灵活的鸟成群地象云似的从他们头上掠过。水手认得这些是海鸥和鸳鸯，它们的尖叫连奔腾澎湃的潮水声也掩盖不了。
这些遇难人不时站下来高声喊叫，倾听着海上有没有回音。他们认为，如果工程师已经登岸，而他们离登岸地点又不太远，那么即使史密斯没法表示他在这里，他们至少也可以听见托普的叫声。他们站下来静听，但除了澎湃的海水和拍岸的惊涛之外，什么也听不到。于是这一小伙人继续前进，找遍了海滨的每一个角落。
徒步走了二十分钟以后，这四个遇难的人突然发现脚下白浪翻腾，只得停下来。陆地到此为止了。他们发觉自己来到一个海角的尽头，海水猛烈地冲击着它的尖端。
“这是一个海角，”水手说，“我们只好按原路回去，向着右边走，这样我们就能返回本土了。”
“也许他就在那里呢，我们还是再喊几声吧！”纳布一面说，一面指着黑暗中白浪滔天的大海，于是他们又齐声大喊起来，但是没有响应，他们稍停了片刻，又喊了一次，还是没有回音。
遇难的人只好回去了；他们沿着海角的另一边走着，这里不但遍地沙石，而且道路崎岖。但是，潘克洛夫发现海岸较直，地面也高起来了，他告诉大家，这里毗连着丘陵斜坡；通过浓雾，他隐隐约约地望到山峦的雄姿。这一带海岸上鸟类较少，海水的喧嚣声也不大；他们还注意到波涛减弱了。几乎听不到拍岸的波涛声。海角的这一面显然形成了一个半圆形的海港，海里的浪花掩盖着海角的尖端。循着这个方向是通往南边的，正和史密斯可能登陆的海岸遥遥相对。步行了一英里半之后，他们在海岸上找不着拐回北边去的弯路了。这个海角——他们曾经绕过它的尽头——一定是和本土相连的。他们虽然已经筋疲力尽，但还是鼓起勇气前进，随时盼望突然遇到一个转角，使他们能回到原地去。走了差不多两英里以后，到了一个高耸的地岬上，遍地都是又湿又滑的岩石，又被海水阻挡住了，他们不禁大失所望。
潘克洛夫说：“我们是在一个小岛上，我们已经从它的一端勘察到另一端了。”
水手说得对；他们落下来的地方不是大陆，甚至也不是海岛，而只是一个小岛，它全长还不到两英里，宽度就更短了。
这一片海鸟栖身的荒地上，满地都是乱石，一点草木也不生，它是不是还和其他较重要的群岛相连呢？这很难说。飞航员在吊篮里的时候，透过云雾看见了陆地，但是他们没来得及仔细观察。尽管这样，潘克洛夫航海多年，他的眼睛在昏暗中几乎还是可以肯定西方朦胧的巨影就是隆起的海岸。不过在黑暗中他们不能断定那是一个孤岛，还是和其他岛屿相连。他们也不能离开这个岛，因为周围都是大海；因此他们只好把寻找工程师的事情拖到第二天。糟糕的是他们连一声叫喊都没有听到，没法知道工程师的死活。
“我们的朋友虽然默不作声，但这并不能说明什么问题，”通讯记者说。“他也许晕过去了，也许受了伤，不能马上回答，我们不必灰心。”
随后通讯记者提议在小岛上燃起一堆火来给工程师作为信号。但是这里遍地都是沙石，找不到任何树枝或干枯的荆棘。纳布和他的伙伴们对勇敢的史密斯都非常敬爱，他们的悲痛只能用画笔来描绘，而不是文字所能形容的。显然，他们已经没法去帮助他了。他们只能尽量忍耐到天亮。除非工程师能够自己逃生，在海岸上找到一个避难的地方，要不然他就是永远离开了这个世界！漫长而痛苦的时光过去了。天气非常寒冷。遇难的人处境十分困难，但是他们几乎没有感觉到。他们连一分钟也不想休息。一心想着他们的首领，他们怀着希望，或者说还抱着一线希望在这一片不毛之地上继续奔走，几次回到小岛的北端，也就是离遇难地点最近的地方。他们倾听、喊叫、齐声高呼，他们打算叫得更响亮一些，使遥远的地方也能听见。现在已经风平浪静。纳布有一次喊叫以后甚至仿佛传来了回声，赫伯特提醒潘克洛夫说：“这说明西边不远的地方有海岸。”水手点点头，他相信自己的眼睛是不会欺骗他的。他只要发现了陆地，不管多么模糊不请，那儿就准有陆地。可是回答纳布呼唤的只是遥远的回声，而小岛整个的东部却是一片昏暗。
在这期间，天空逐渐清朗起来了。午夜的时候，已经是满天星斗，如果工程师在这里，他就会告诉他的伙伴，这不是北半球的星星。这里看不见北极星，星座也不是美国常见的那些了，南十字座在天空闪耀着亮光。
黑夜过去了。3月25日消晨将近五点钟的时候，天渐渐地亮了，地平线上还是黑黝黝的一片。破晓时分，海面上升起了一抹朝雾，他们站在那里连二十英尺以外的东西都看不清楚。最后大片的浓雾动荡不停地四散飘开。
然而不幸得很，这些遇难的人还是看不见周围有任何东西。通讯记者和纳布仔细地视察着海洋，水手和赫伯特急切地寻找看西边有没有海岸。可是连一点陆地的影子也没有。“不要紧，”潘克洛夫说，“虽然我没有看见陆地，可是我感觉得出来……那里准有陆地……正象我们目前已经不在里士满那样肯定。”朝雾不久就停止上升，这不过是晴天的烟霭。炎热的阳光不久就射到海岛上来了。大约在六点半钟左右，也就是太阳升起后三刻钟的时候，烟雾更加淡薄。它的上层逐渐浓厚，而下层却消散了。不久个岛就好象从云端里降下来似的，整个地现了出来。同时周围海洋也显现出来了，它在东面向远处伸展出去，可是西面却被突然插入的险滩挡住了。
是的！那里有陆地。至少他们暂时可以安全了，小岛和对岸之间有一条半英里宽的海峡，海峡里水流湍急。
这时，有一个遇难的人由于内心的驱使，没有同伙伴们商量，就一言不发地跳下水去了，这就是纳布。他急于要到对岸，并向北边爬去。他们拦也拦不住他。潘克洛夫喊他也不听。通讯记者打算跟着去，可是潘克洛夫把他拦住了。“你打算渡过海峡吗？”他问道。“是的。”史佩莱回答说。“好！”水手说：“等一会儿，纳布一个人足够帮助他的主人了。假如我们冒险跳到海峡里去，那就有被急流冲到大海里去的危险；如果我没有看错的话，现在正退潮。你瞧，沙滩上的潮水退下去了。别着急，水浅的时候我们就容易找到一条可以涉水过去的道路了。”“你说得对，”通讯记者答道，“我们不要太分散了，免得大家没法互相照顾。”
这时候纳布正和潮流激烈地搏斗。他在斜渡海峡。当他划水的时候，水里露出他的黑肩膀来。他很快地被冲往下游去，但终于接近了对岸。从小岛横渡到对岸需要半个钟头以上，当他上岸的时候，离对面的出发点已经有几百英尺了。
他在一片高大的花岗石壁下登了岸，用力抖了一下身子，然后拔脚就跑，一会儿工夫就消失在一个岩石的海角后面了。这个海角几乎和小岛北端的高度相等。
纳布的伙伴们焦急地望着他的大胆尝试。当他的身影消失以后，他们就一面吃散布在沙滩上的贝壳动物，一面注视他们寄托着安全希望的陆地，这种食物虽然很难吃，但总比饿着肚子强一些。对岸形成一个宽阔的港湾，南端是一个险峻的海角，上面寸草不生，看起来非常荒凉。这个海角毗连海岸，形成一道奇形怪状的花岗石轮廓，高耸在地面上。相反地，愈向北港湾就愈加宽了，这里的海岸显得更加迂曲，从西南弯向东北，终点形成一个狭长的地角。构成港湾弓形地带的两端之间相距八英里左右。小岛离海岸半英里，很象一条大鲸鱼。最宽的地方也不过四分之一英里。
小岛对面海滩的最低层是沙砾，上面散布着黑石头。退潮以后，这些石头都慢慢地露出来了。海滩的第二层有一道垂直的花岗石峭壁把它隔开，峭壁的顶端参差不齐，至少高达三百英尺。峭壁连绵三英里，右方伸展到一座好象人工凿开的断崖处突然终止了。左边，在海角的上面，这座参差不齐的悬崖下降成一片很长的砾岩山坡，一直湮没在南角的地面上。海滨的高地上一棵树也没有，有些象好望角开普敦的平坦台地，只是显得小一些；至少从小岛上看来是这样的。悬崖的右边倒有不少青翠的植物。他们一眼就看见一大片望不到边的树林。看了绵延起伏的花岗石丘陵，再看这一片苍翠的绿荫，不禁使他们感到满目清凉。最后，越过高原，在西北至少七英里远的地方，他们看见一个白色的山巅在阳光里闪闪发光。这是一座顶端积雪的高山。
这片土地究竟是一个孤岛，还是和大陆相连，现在还很难说，可是地质学家们看了左边那些由于地震所形成的石堆以后，一定会毫不犹豫地指出，这是由火山爆发引起的，因为这些东西无疑是大地内部震动的结果。
吉丁•史佩莱、潘克洛夫和赫伯特仔细地考察了这片土地。也许他们要在这里住上好几年。假如这个荒岛远离船舶的经常航线，那么他们甚至可能要在这里待一辈子。
赫伯特问道：“喂，潘克洛夫，你认为怎么样？”
“跟任何事情一样，有好的一面，也有坏的一面，”水手答道。“等着瞧吧，现在显然正在退潮，三个钟头之后我们就可以想法子过去了。只要一到对岸，就可以想法子脱离这个困难的境地，我认为是可能找到史密斯的。”果然不出潘克洛夫所料，三个钟头以后，在低潮的时候，海峡有大部分都露出了沙滩。小岛和对岸之间只留下一条很窄的水道，要渡过去显然是很容易的。
十点钟左右，吉丁•史佩莱和他的伙伴们脱去衣服，捆起来顶在头上，然后跨进不到五英尺深的海水。赫伯特嫌水太深，就象一条鱼似的很出色地游过去了。三个人都顺利地抵达了对岸。他们在阳光下很快晒干了身子，穿上衣服——他们没有让衣服浸湿——然后坐下来商量下一步该怎么办。
Book 1 Chapter 4
All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany him.
"Stop here, my boy," said the sailor; "we have to prepare an encampment, and to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our friends will want something when they come back. There is work for everybody."
"I am ready," replied Herbert.
"All right," said the sailor; "that will do. We must set about it regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have shelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests; we have only to find a house."
"Very well," returned Herbert, "I will look for a cave among the rocks, and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep."
"All right," said Pencroft; "go on, my boy."
They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far from which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the north, they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet from the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which he thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream of water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown Cyrus Harding on the shore there.
The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed by the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as a dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even the waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long, flat, pointed beaks--a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man, who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft recognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little sea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite. A shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to fire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one; besides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their eggs have a detestable taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward a little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed, which, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide. On these rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not to be despised by starving people. Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up hastily.
"Here are mussels!" cried the sailor; "these will do instead of eggs!"
"They are not mussels," replied Herbert, who was attentively examining the molluscs attached to the rocks; "they are lithodomes."
"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft.
"Perfectly so."
"Then let us eat some lithodomes."
The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural history, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best professors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious lad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course of time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering very tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is rounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common mussel.
Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were then half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had a strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any sort.
Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which increased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to find fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such a capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken the precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which they filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the cliff.
Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to be ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a little creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle. The watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and its two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which began to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off.
"Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!" said Pencroft. "Well, Herbert, now we only want the house."
The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this time--that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach it --it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.
However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and which bear the name of "Chimneys."
Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the openings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also air--a regular corridor-gale--and with the wind the sharp cold from the exterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be rendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical sign "&," which signifies "et cetera" abridged, but by isolating the upper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so strongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use.
"Here's our work," said Pencroft, "and if we ever see Captain Harding again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth."
"We shall see him again, Pencroft," cried Herbert, "and when be returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke."
"So we can, my boy," replied the sailor, "and these Chimneys will serve our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings, through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends."
Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they began to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite rapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide--and it could already be perceived--must drive it back with force to a considerable distance. The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and flow for the transport of heavy objects.
After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left. From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent trees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the advanced season, for they belonged to the family of "coniferae," which is spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to the tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the "deedara," which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around them a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up clusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around. Among the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry branches which crackled like fireworks.
"Well, my boy," said he to Herbert, "if I don't know the name of these trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them 'burning wood,' and just now that's the chief thing we want."
"Let us get a supply," replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.
The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet; but if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet found. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the loads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.
"Well, my boy," replied the sailor, "there must be some way of carrying this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart or a boat, it would be easy enough."
"But we have the river," said Herbert.
"Right," replied Pencroft; "the river will be to us like a road which carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing."
"Only," observed Herbert, "at this moment our road is going the wrong way, for the tide is rising!"
"We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs," replied the sailor, "and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get the raft ready."
The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river. They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood bound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead branches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably never before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind of little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current, the sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which they had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have loaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the raft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.
There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a more extended view of the surrounding country.
Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall, terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge of the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began their ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the summit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of the river.
On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long before they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed, with emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the catastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had disappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to which a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but one vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither the reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at this time they were both too far away to be perceived.
"Something tells me," cried Herbert, "that a man as energetic as Captain Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have reached some point of the shore; don't you think so, Pencroft?"
The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: "Doubtless, doubtless," said he; "our engineer is a man who would get out of a scrape to which any one else would yield."
In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched out below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river's mouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like amphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea sparkled beneath the sun's rays. To the south a sharp point closed the horizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made this coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then returned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles. From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here and there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little river; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the mountain, among which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite walls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on the right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides changed to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point.
"Are we on an island?" murmured the sailor.
"At any rate, it seems to be big enough," replied the lad.
"An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!" said Pencroft.
But this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect survey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied in its productions.
"This is satisfactory," observed Pencroft; "and in our misfortune, we must thank Providence for it."
"God be praised!" responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of gratitude to the Author of all things.
Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an inspection what the future had in store for them.
They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite platform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most whimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole flock of these winged creatures.
"Oh!" cried he, "those are not gulls nor sea-mews!"
"What are they then?" asked Pencroft.
"Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!"
"Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by the double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their slate- colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in their nests!"
"We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an omelet!" replied Pencroft merrily.
"But what will you make your omelet in?" asked Herbert; "in your hat?"
"Well!" replied the sailor, "I am not quite conjuror enough for that; we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to despatch the hardest!"
Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite, and they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being collected, were packed in the sailor's handkerchief, and as the time when the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began to redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was an hour after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not intend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither did he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never at a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft rapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This vegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the sailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with a long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The enormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before two o'clock they arrived at the river's mouth, a few paces from the Chimneys.
突然，通讯记者跳起来，叫水手在原地等他，然后他就顺着几小时以前纳布所爬过的方向攀上了悬崖。他急于想知道朋友的下落，因此急急忙忙地加快了步子，马上就绕过峭壁的拐角不见了。赫伯特想跟他一起去。
“别去，孩子，”水手说，“我们要准备一个过宿的地方，再想法子弄点儿比贝类动物好吃的东西。他们回来后需要吃点儿。各人都有自己的工作。”
“那我们马上就动手吧。”赫伯特说。
“好，”水手说，“干吧，我们要好好地布置一下。我们又累、又冷、又饿，因此必须找个住的地方，生一堆火，找点吃的。森林里有柴，鸟窝里有蛋，只要找个安身的地方就行了。”
“很好，”赫伯特说，“我去找个山洞，我相信一定能找到一个容纳得下我们的山洞。”
“好，”潘克洛夫说，“去吧，孩子。”
他们两个人走到海滩的庞大石壁底下，潮水离这里已经很远了，他们没有往北走，而是向南。潘克洛夫在着陆时注意到几百步以外的地方有一个狭窄的山口，他认为那可能是一条河或小溪的出口。现在他们正需要在一条这样的淡水河旁边安身；另一方面海流也可能把赛勒斯•史密斯冲到这里的岸边来。
前面已经说过，悬崖高达三百英尺，它从上到下没有一个空洞，波涛难得冲到它下面，所以连一点能够容身的裂缝都没有。悬崖是一片坚实而陡峭的花岗岩，连海水也没法侵蚀它。无数的海鸥在悬崖顶上盘旋着，其中最多的是蹼足鸟类，它们的尖嘴又扁又长，叽叽喳喳地叫个不休，看见人一点也不害怕——也许这还是人类第一次侵犯它们的领土。在这些鸟当中，潘克洛夫认得有一种就是人家通常称做游禽类的大鸥，另外还有无数贪吃的小海鸥隐藏在花岗岩峭壁的缝隙里。向它们开一枪，准能打死很多，首先自然要有枪，但是潘克洛夫和赫伯特都无枪可放。再说，这些海鸥的肉都是难以下咽的，连它们的蛋也都腥臭难闻，赫伯特又向左走了几步，忽然碰到一堆覆盖着海藻的乱石，几小时以后潮水就要把这里淹没了。在这些岩石上和又湿又滑的海藻之间，到处是蛤蜊类，饿着肚子的人见了以后，是不会轻易放过的。赫伯特喊了一声潘克洛夫，水手连忙跑过来。
“怎么！都是贻贝吗？”水手喊道，“这可以代替鸟蛋了！”
“不是贻贝，”赫伯特一面回答，一面仔细观察岩石上的那些软体动物，“是茨蟹。”
“好吃吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“好吃极了。”
“那我们就吃些茨蟹吧。”
水手很信任赫伯特；少年不但热爱博物学，而且精通这门科学。他的父亲曾经鼓励他在这方面钻研，并且让他旁听波士顿名教授讲课，那些教授都很喜欢这个聪明好学的少年。过去他已经不止一次地证明了博物学的用处，这一次他也没有弄错。这些茨蟹有椭圆形的贝壳，它们成群地紧粘在岩石上，一动也不动。它们属于穿孔类软体动物，能在最坚硬的岩石中挖洞；它们的外壳两端浑圆，这是一般贻贝所没有的特征。
潘克洛夫和赫伯特饱餐了一顿在日光中半开着壳的茨蟹。他们象吃蛤蜊似的吃着。茨蟹的味道很辣，不加任何作料也非常可口。
他们暂时总算吃饱了，然而吃了这些“自来香”的软体动物之后，觉得更加口渴了，因此必须喝水。在这一带特别崎岖的地方，看来是不会找不着淡水的。潘克洛夫和赫伯特捡了许多茨蟹，装满了衣袋和手帕，就回到悬崖下面去。
他们走了二百步左右，到了潘克洛夫曾认为可能有河水流出来的那个山口，只是究竟是不是淡水，那还不能肯定。这里的石壁好象是由于剧烈的地震裂开的，石壁底下是一股小溪，溪流的尽头形成一个相当尖锐的弯角。那段水流宽达一百英尺，两岸不到二十英尺高。河水在花岗石的夹壁间流得非常急。石壁俯临河口，然后，河身突然拐了个弯，消失在半英里以外的矮树林中了。
“这里有水，那里有我们需要的木柴！”潘克洛夫说，“赫伯特，现在我们只少住的地方了。”
河水是清澈的。水手相信河水在这时候——也就是海水还没有随着涨潮倒灌进来的时候——是清甜适口的。这个重要的问题解决了以后，赫伯特就去找可以藏身的山洞了，但是到处都是平滑陡峭的石壁，因此找来找去毫无效果。
但是，在河口比涨潮后的水面较高的地方，大地的剧烈震动叠起了一大堆的岩石——不是普通的岩洞——这种高大的岩石堆就是在花岗右产地常见的所谓“石窟”。
潘克洛夫和赫伯特钻进岩石堆，沿着沙路走了很远，这里光线并不很暗，因为有阳光可以从石缝照进来；有些石块象奇迹似的保持着平衡，随着阳光，风也透了进来，形成一般的过堂风；随着风，外面的寒气也进来了。但是，水手却认为如果用沙石把一部分石缝堵住，“石窟”里是可以居住的。它的平面图很象印刷体中的“＆”字，也就是拉丁文“和”字的缩写。的确，只要把上面那个口堵住，不让强烈的西风和南风吹进来，他们就可以利用它在下面安身了。
“我们有活干啦，”潘克洛夫说，“要是我们能找到史密斯先生的话，他一定会很好地利用这座迷宫的。”
“我们准会找到他的，潘克洛夫，”赫伯特大声说，“等他回来的时候，一定要让他在这里瞧见一所象样的住宅。如果我们在左边通道里生火，再留个洞口出烟，那就行了。”
“那好办，孩子，”水手答道，“‘石窟’够我们用的了。我们动手吧，可是首先要去弄些木柴来。我觉得可以用树枝来堵塞这些石缝，要不然风吹进来就好象鬼叫似的。”
赫伯特和潘克洛夫离开了“石窟”，转过拐角，爬上河的左岸。这里水势非常湍急，一棵枯树顺流往下冲来。上涨的潮水——现在已经可以看出来了——必然会有力地把它推回很远。于是水手考虑到可以利用潮水的涨落来运送较重的东西。
走了一刻钟以后，水手和少年来到河流向左弯曲的拐角处。在这里，河水流过一片美丽的森林。虽然已经是秋天了，这些树木还保持着苍翠的颜色。这种松柏科的树木布满了地球上的各个区域，从北方较冷的地区一直延伸到热带。这位少年博物学家特别认得出那发散出一股清香的是喜马拉雅杉，在这些美丽的杉树中间，还夹杂着枞树，它们向四周伸展着浓密而宽阔的伞形树枝。当他们在深草丛中走过的时候，枯枝在潘克洛夫的脚下发出鞭炮一样的响声。
“孩子，”他对赫伯特说，“虽然我不知道这些树的名字，至少我们可以把它叫做‘柴树’，眼前我们最需要的就是它。”
“我们多弄点回去吧。”赫伯特一面回答，一面就动手收集起来。
收集木柴毫不费力，满地都是枯枝，他们甚至不必到树上去折。虽然有了燃料，运输的办法却一时还想不出来。木柴很干，燃烧起来一定很快；应该多搞点回去！据赫伯特估计，两个人所能带走的还不够用。
“孩子，”水手说，“一定得想个法子搬运木柴，不论干什么都得有个办法。要是我们有一辆大车或是一只船，那就好办了。”
“但是我们有河。”赫伯特说。
“对，”潘克洛夫说，“河就是我们的自动运输线，我们可以做个木筏。”
“不过，”赫伯特说，“现在我们这运输线的方向不对了，正在涨潮呢！”
“等到退潮的时候就行了，”水手答道，“那时候我们就可以借着河流把燃料运到‘石窟’去。我们先把木筏做好吧。”
水手带领着赫伯特，直向河边走去。他们两个人各尽自己的力量，把成捆的木柴搬去。在河畔草丛里他们又找到大量的枯枝，这里大概从来也不曾有人来过。潘克洛夫马上就开始造木筏了。堤岸的一部分突入河里，使水势减弱，形成一个小港。水手和少年就在这里安排了几根很粗的木头，用爬藤把它们绑在一起。这样就造成了一只木筏。他们把捡来的木柴都堆在上面，真的，这些木柴二十个人也搬不完。一个钟头以后，工作就完成了，木筏系在岸边，只等退潮了。
离退潮还有几个钟头，潘克洛夫和赫伯特商量好以后，决定爬上高地去，看一看周围更远的景物。
离河流的拐角整整二百英尺的地方，石壁的一端往下倾斜，慢漫地伸展到森林的边缘，然后平伏下去了。这是一座天然的梯子。赫伯特和水手往上走去，他们身强力壮，几分钟的工夫就到达了山顶，然后走到俯临河口的地方。
上山以后，他们首先看见的是他们在十分危险的情况下曾经渡过的海洋。他们以激动的心情望着海岸的北部地区。赛勒斯•史密斯就是在那里失踪的！他们希望能够看到气球的一点残骸，史密斯很可能还攀在上面。可是什么也没有，周围只是辽阔无边的海洋。海岸上同样是一个人也没有。到处都没有通讯记者和纳布的踪迹。也许这时候他们离得太远了，所以看不见。
“我总觉得，”赫伯特大声说，“象史密斯那样能干的人是不会象平常人一样被淹死的。他一定是在什么地方上岸了，你是不是也这样想，潘克洛夫？”
水手闷声不响摇摇头。他似乎觉得再也不能见到赛勒斯•史密斯了，但他不愿意使赫伯特灰心，因此说：“当然，当然，就是在别人毫无办法的情况下，工程师也是能够脱险的。”
在那一段时间中，他仔细地观察了海滨。下面是一片沙滩，它向外伸展出去，直到河口的右边就被翻滚的浪花拦住了，露出来的礁石象水陆两栖的怪物似的躺在波涛里。礁石以外的大海在阳光下闪闪发光。南面的水平线被一个突出的海角遮住了，看不见陆地是顺着那个方向伸展出去，还是延向东南和西南，使海岸成为一个很长的半岛。在港湾北部的尽头，海岸的轮廓延伸到很远的地方，形成一个很大的弧形。那里的海滨地势平坦，没有悬崖，只有退潮后露出来的大片沙滩。潘克洛夫和赫伯特然后就回身向西走去。他们首先注意到六七英里外那座顶端积雪的高山。从离海岸两英里以内一直到山坡开始下斜的地方，生长着大片的树木，还有许多常绿树点缀在里面，因此看上去一大片苍翠的绿荫，并不觉得单调。从森林的边缘直到海边是一片平原，上面东一堆西一堆地生长着树丛。左边的林间空地上闪耀着小河的流水；沿着这条弯弯曲曲的小河可以溯流到山岭的支脉间去，河水似乎是从那里发源的。就在水手停靠木筏的地方，它就开始从巍峨的花岗石壁之间流出来；左壁固然峥嵘险峻，右壁却不同，它逐渐倾斜下去，整片的石壁变成一块一块的岩石，岩石又变为石子，石子又变成了沙砾，一直延伸到海角的尽头。
“我们是在一个岛上吗？”水手喃喃地说。
“不管怎么样，这个岛似乎还够大的。”少年答道。
“不管多大，岛终归还是个岛！”潘克洛夫说。
但是这个重要的问题一时还不能得到解答。要解决这问题就必须更全面地察看一下。不论是岛也好，是大陆也好，这里的土地看起来是肥沃的，风景也很好，物产也很丰富。
“不错，”潘克洛夫说，“有这样的地方可算是不幸中的大幸了。”
“谢天谢地。”赫伯特说，他虔诚地对上苍表示万分的感谢。
潘克洛夫和赫伯特在他们落难的这片土地上观察了好久，可是这样走马看花的看了一遍，也很难想象出他们未来的命运如何。
后来他们就沿着花岗石台地的南边山脊往回走了，台地的边缘是一道奇形怪状、参差不齐的石块。石穴里栖息着成千成百的飞鸟；赫伯特从石头上跳下来，惊起了大群的飞禽。
“啊！”他喊道，“这不是海鸥，也不是沙鸥！”
“那么是什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道。“我想也许是鸽子！”
“对了，不过这些是野鸽子，或者是山鸽子，它们的翅膀上有两道黑纹，尾巴是白的，羽毛是青灰色的，所以我认得出来，野鸽子肉本来就很好吃，它们的蛋想必更加好吃了，我们去瞧瞧它们的窝里有多少蛋！”
“我们不给它们时间孵蛋了，除非它们能够孵出荷包蛋来！”潘克洛夫兴致勃勃地说。
“现在你打算用什么东西来煎荷包蛋呢？”赫伯特说，“用你的帽子吗？”
“好哇！”水手回答说，“我可不会变这样的戏法。我们只好将就些吃泡蛋罢，最硬的蛋给我来解决！”
潘克洛夫和赫伯特在花岗石的空隙里仔细搜了一遍，果然在一些洞穴里找到一些鸟蛋。他们捡了好几打，包在水手的手帕里。快要到满潮的时候，潘克洛夫和赫伯特就从山上下来，回头往河边走会。到达河边的时候已经是午后一点钟。海潮已经回头了。现在他们必须利用低潮把木材运送到河口去。潘克洛夫不愿意亲自在筏上掌握方向，可也不能让木筏无人照管而随波逐流，虽然没有绳索和钢缆，可是一个水手是不会因为这个而毫无办法的；潘克洛夫很快就用干爬藤拧成一条几寻长的绳子。他把这根藤索系在木筏的后部，用手控制着另一端，赫伯特用一根长竿把木筏撑开，使它漂浮在水流上。这件工作做得非常圆满，大批的木柴随着水流漂去了。河岸很平坦，丝毫不用担心木筏会在水中打旋。还不到下午两点钟，他们就来到河口，离“石窟”只有几步远了。
Book 1 Chapter 5
Pencroft's first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand, stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the south winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to lead out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided into three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would scarcely have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and there was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which occupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.
"Perhaps," said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, "our companions have found a superior place to ours."
"Very likely," replied the seaman; "but, as we don't know, we must work all the same. Better to have two strings to one's bow than no string at all!"
"Oh!" exclaimed Herbert, "how jolly it will be if they were to find Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!"
"Yes, indeed!" said Pencroft, "that was a man of the right sort."
"Was!" exclaimed Herbert, "do you despair of ever seeing him again?"
"God forbid!" replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft declared himself very well satisfied.
"Now," said he, "our friends can come back when they like. They will find a good enough shelter."
They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper--an easy task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take the heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature inside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.
"Certainly," replied Pencroft, "and I may say happily, for without matches or tinder we should be in a fix."
"Still we might get fire as the savages do," replied Herbert, "by rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other."
"All right; try, my boy, and let's see if you can do anything besides exercising your arms."
"Well, it's a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of the Pacific."
"I don't deny it," replied Pencroft, "but the savages must know how to do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer matches. By the bye, where are my matches?"
Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there, for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover the box.
"Here's a go!" said he, looking at Herbert. "The box must have fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have something--a tinder-box--anything that can possibly make fire!"
"No, I haven't, Pencroft."
The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the rocks, near the river's bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain. The box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.
"Pencroft," asked Herbert, "didn't you throw it out of the car?"
"I knew better than that," replied the sailor; "but such a small article could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I would rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?"
"Look here, the tide is going down," said Herbert; "let's run to the place where we landed."
It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves had rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well to try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had landed the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing. If the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the waves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with no result. It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the time irreparable. Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very anxious, but said not a word. Herbert tried to console him by observing, that if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been wetted by the sea and useless.
"No, my boy," replied the sailor; "they were in a copper box which shut very tightly; and now what are we to do?"
"We shall certainly find some way of making a fire," said Herbert. "Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them."
"Yes," replied Pencroft; "but in the meantime we are without fire, and our companions will find but a sorry repast on their return."
"But," said Herbert quickly, "do you think it possible that they have no tinder or matches?"
"I doubt it," replied the sailor, shaking his head, "for neither Neb nor Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep his note-book than his match-box."
Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or other. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate, there was only one thing to be done--to await the return of Neb and the reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect either for themselves or for the others.
Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of fire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.
Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle where the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it in every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the forest, all in vain.
It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave. It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards six o'clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the return of Neb and Spilett.
They were returning alone! . . . . The boy's heart sank; the sailor had not been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not been found!
The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying anything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength to utter a word.
As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.
The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary; not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a trace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach. It was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by a human being. The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a tomb.
As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which showed how hope struggled within him, "No! he is not dead! he can't be dead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get out of anything!" Then his strength forsaking him, "Oh! I can do no more!" he murmured.
"Neb," said Herbert, running to him, "we will find him! God will give him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat something."
So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything for several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live without his master.
As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm. Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, "Sir," said he, "we have found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is advancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther."
The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he happened to have a match or two.
The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, "I had some, but I must have thrown them away."
The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same answer.
"Confound it!" exclaimed the sailor.
The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, "Have you no matches?" he asked.
"Not one, and no fire in consequence."
"Ah!" cried Neb, "if my master was here, he would know what to do!"
The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other. Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, "Mr. Spilett, you are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven't looked well, try again, a single match will be enough!"
The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and great-coat, and at last to Pencroft's great joy, no less to his extreme surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his waistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could not get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great importance not to rub off the phosphorus.
"Will you let me try?" said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood which was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.
"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft; "it is as good as having a whole cargo!" He took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.
This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the greatest caution.
The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, "We must have some paper," said he.
"Here," replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his note-book.
Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.
Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart, holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to rub off the phosphorus.
"No, I can't do it," said he, "my hand trembles, the match has missed fire; I cannot, I will not!" and rising, he told Herbert to take his place.
Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He did not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.
A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making a choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds too caught fire, and then the moss.
A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the darkness.
"At last!" cried Pencroft, getting up; "I was never so nervous before in all my life!"
The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily out at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was not long in being felt.
They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to keep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.
Pencroft's first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were brought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these preparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had survived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of making known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore. He was like a body without a soul.
Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no choice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under the hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman invited the reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs were excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man's nourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were much strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing at this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been all there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire on the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven! But the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even obtained a burial-place.
Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking on the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a deafening noise.
The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not spare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The inconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions could say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on the shore calling on his master.
潘克洛夫把木筏上的干柴卸下来以后，首先就忙着要把那些灌风的窟窿堵上，使山洞能够住人。用沙土、石头、弯枝、烂泥，封闭了面迎着南风的洞口。旁边留下了一道弯曲的细缝，既能通烟，又能拔火。这个洞窟就这样分成了三四间房（假如还配得上称房间的话），这里面光线黑暗，野兽才满意哩。但是洞里却很干燥，中央的主要房间还可以站直身子。他们在地上又铺了一层细沙。这一切布置妥当之后，他们认为非常满意，因为除此以外再也找不到更好的地方了。
“也许我们的伙伴已经找到比这儿更好的地方了。”赫伯特一面帮着潘克洛夫工作，一面说。
“很可能，”水手说，“但是既然我们不知道，就必须照常进行工作。备而不用总比要用没有强！”
“啊！”赫伯特大声说，“要是他们能把史密斯先生找回来，那多好啊！”
“是的，一点也不错！”潘克洛夫说，“他活着的话，真是个了不起的人。”
“活着！”赫伯特大声说，“你认为不可能再看见他了吗？”
“谁说的？”水手说。他们的工作很快就结束了，潘克洛夫表示非常满意。
“现在，”他说，“现在我们的朋友回来。他们有一个很好的地方安身了。”
他们目前只差造个炉子生火做饭了。这事情非常容易。他们在保留下来的细缝口下面铺了几块平板石。只要烟不把热气带出去，就可以使里面保持适当的温度。他们的木柴贮存在另一间里，水手在生火的地方摆了一些木柴和树枝。水手正忙得起劲，突然赫伯特问他有没有火柴。
“当然有啦，”潘克洛夫说，“我可以作为一个好消息告诉你，因为要是没有火柴或火绒，那我们就没有办法了。”
“我们还是可以象土人那样擦木取火的。”赫伯特说。
“好，你试试吧！孩子，除了能使你的胳膊活动活动之外，看你能不能磨出火来。”
“嘿，这太简单了，太平洋海岛上的土人常用这个办法。”
“这一点我承认，”潘克洛夫回答说，“不过我试过好几次都弄不出火来，大概土人有什么特别的方法，要不然就是用的木头不一样。我看还是火柴好用。哎呀，我的火柴上哪儿去了？”
潘克洛夫是个烟鬼，他平时总是把火柴盒放在坎肩口袋里，他伸手去摸，没有摸到，摸遍了裤子口袋，哪儿也没有火柴盒，他不禁吃了一惊。
“糟糕！”他看着赫伯特说。“口袋里的火柴盒一定是丢了！赫伯特，你总有火绒盒什么的能生火吧？”
“不，我没有，潘克洛夫。”
孩子跟着水手往外跑去，他们在沙滩上、石缝里和河岸上仔细找。火柴盒是铜的，本来很容易看见，但是到处都找遍了，还是找不到。
“潘克洛夫，”赫伯特问道，“你没有从吊篮里把它扔出去吗？”
“我记得清清楚楚没有扔掉，”水手回答说，“不过这么小的东西是很容易在忙乱中丢失的。真要丢的话，我宁可丢烟斗！真糟糕！火柴盒哪儿去了？”
“你瞧，现在退潮了，”赫伯特说，“到我们着陆的地方去看看吧。”
要想找到火柴盒恐怕是不太可能了，在涨潮的时候，沙滩上的鹅卵石都被海浪冲过了，但是，试一下也好。赫伯特和潘克洛夫急忙走到昨天着陆的地点，这里离山洞大约有二百步。他们在砾石堆和岩缝里乱找，但是什么也没有找到。假如丢在这个地方，那么它一定被海浪冲走了。退潮以后，他们找遍了每一个缝隙，但还是白费力气。在他们当时的情况下说来，这真是莫大的损失，而且这个损失还是没法弥补的。潘克洛夫隐藏不住自己的不安，皱着眉头，急得一句话也说不出来。赫伯特只好安慰他说，即使找到火柴，也一定被海水浸湿，不能使用了。
“不，孩子，”水手说，“火柴是装在盖得严严的铜盒子里的，现在我们该怎么办呢？”
“我们一定有办法生火的！”赫伯特说。“史密斯先生和史佩莱先生是不会没有火柴的。”
“不错，”潘克洛夫答道，“可是远水不解近渴呀，他们回来也吃不到好东西了。”
“那么，”赫伯特很快地说，“你看他们会不会没有洋火或火绒吗？”
“我看不一定有，”水手摇着头回答说，“纳布和史密斯都不抽烟，史佩莱是宁愿扔掉火柴盒也得留下他那个笔记本的。”
赫伯特没有回答。丢了火柴盒的确令人感到遗憾，但是少年还是相信能用别的方法生出火来。潘克洛夫的经历比较丰富，他从来也不自寻苦恼，但是他的想法却和少年不一样。不管怎样，他们只好等纳布和通讯记者回来，只好放弃煮蛋的计划。不论对他们自己或是对别人来说，生吞活咽总不是一件舒服的事。
火肯定是弄不到了，水手和赫伯特就又捡了些蛤蜊，然后默默地回“石窟”去。
潘克洛夫两眼紧盯着地面，还在继续寻找他的火柴盒。他甚至爬上河的左岸，从河口一直找到停靠木筏的河湾。他又回到高地上去四下搜索，森林边缘的深草丛中也找遍了，但还是没有。
傍晚五点钟的时候，他和赫伯特回到“石窟”里。不用说，他们把洞里最黑暗的角落都摸索遍了，这才死了心不再去找。大约六点钟，太阳正在落山的时候，在海滨漫步的赫伯特报告纳布和史佩莱回来了。
他们没有找到史密斯！……少年心里很失望；水手并没有猜错，工程师赛勒斯•史密斯果然没有找到！
通讯记者回来之后，一言不发，往石头上一坐。他已经筋疲力竭，肚子又饿，连说话的气力也没有了。
纳布哭得两眼通红，他的眼泪还在不住地往下掉，显然他已经完全绝望了。
通讯记者叙述了他们尽力寻找赛勒斯•史密斯的经过。他和纳布沿着海岸一直找到八英里以外，远远走过气球最后一次降落的地方，那次降落以后，工程师和托普就失踪了。海岸上冷清清地没有一个人，没有任何痕迹。鹅卵石完全没有动过，沙滩上没有迹象，那一带的海滨连一个脚印也没有。显然，从来也没有人到那段海岸上去过。大海和陆地同样荒凉，工程师一定是在离岸几百英尺的地方淹死了。
史佩莱说完之后，纳布还抱着希望，他跳起身来大声说，”不！他没有死！他是不可能死的！别人也许会，但是他决不会死！什么灾难他都能逃脱！”接着他喃喃地说：“啊！我受不了！”
“纳布，”赫伯特跑过去对他说，“我们一定能找到他！老天爷会把他还给我们的！现在你饿了，吃点东西吧！”
他一面说，一面递了几把蛤蜊给这可怜的黑人。这些食物实在是既难吃，又不够饱。纳布已经饿了好几个钟头，但还是不肯吃。他失去了主人就不能生活，而且也不愿意一个人活下去。
吉丁•史佩莱狼吞虎咽地吃了些蛤蜊肉，然后倒在岩石脚下的沙土上睡觉了。他很疲倦，情绪也还安定。赫伯特走到他的身旁，握着他的手说：“先生，我们找到一个住处，比躺在这儿强多了。天已经黑了，走，去睡吧！明天我们再到更远的地方去找。”
通讯记者站起身来，跟着孩子往“石窟”走去。在路上，潘克洛夫非常自然地问他身上有没有火柴，哪怕是一两根也好。
通讯记者停下脚步，摸摸他的口袋，但是没有找到，他说，“原先是有的，大概被我扔掉了。”
水手又问了问纳布，他也没有。
“该死！”水手喊道。
通讯记者听见以后，一把抓住他的胳膊问道：“难道你没有火柴吗？”
“一根也没有，因此没法生火！”
“唉！”纳布喊道，“要是主人在这儿，他准有办法的！”
四个遇难的人一动也不动地站在那里，互相不安地观望着。赫伯特首先打破了沉默：“史佩莱先生，你是抽烟的，平时老是带着火柴，大概你没仔细找，再找找看，能有一根就行了！”
通讯记者又在裤子、大衣和坎肩的口袋里搜寻了一遍，没有想到竟在坎肩的里层摸到一根小木棒。潘克洛夫不禁大喜过望，他隔着衬里捏着它，但是拿不出来。假如这真是火柴，那么这就是唯一的一根，必须非常小心，千万不能碰掉火柴头。
“让我试试看，好吗？”孩子说。于是他灵巧地把小木棒拿了出来，并没有把它弄断，这根火柴本身虽然不值一文钱，但是对这些可怜的人说起来，却是非常宝贵的。这根火柴还没有用过。
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“有一根就跟有一整船火柴一样！”
他拿着火柴，领着他的同伴们，往洞里走去。
在有人居住的地方，这样的火柴被随意浪费的太多了，那值不了多少钱；但是这一根在使用的时候，却必须极度小心。
水手首先确定它是干燥的，然后说：“必须预备好引火纸。”
史佩莱犹豫了一下，然后从笔记本上撕下一页来，说：“拿去。”
潘克洛夫从通讯记者手里把纸接过来，跪在柴堆前面，架起木柴，下面垫了一些枯草、树叶和干燥的地苔，这样使空气流通，就容易把干柴点着了。
于是潘克洛夫把纸卷成一个圆锥形筒，象在有风的地方吸烟似的，把纸筒插到地苔里去。然后他捡了一小块粗糙的石头，仔细地擦了擦，他屏住气，心头乱跳，轻轻地在石头上划火柴，划了一下没有划着。原来潘克洛夫怕碰掉火柴头，不敢使劲。
“不成，我干不了这个活，”他说，“我的手直发抖，火柴划不着。不行，我不干了！”于是他站起来，要赫伯特代替他。
的确，这孩子有生以来也没有这么紧张过。当日普罗米修斯上天偷火的时候也不会比他更紧张。然而，他并没有犹豫，拿起火柴来就划。
火柴哧的一声响，接着就燃起一小团蓝色的火苗，冒出一股呛人的烟来。赫伯特不慌不忙地使火柴向下倾斜，这样它就着得更旺了。然后他把火柴放在纸筒里，几秒钟以后，纸筒和地苔都点着了。
水手用嘴使劲吹气，一分钟以后，干柴发出爆炸的声音，一堆熊熊的烈火在黑暗中燃烧起来了。
“谢天谢地！”潘克洛夫站起身来喊道，“我从来也没有这样紧张过！”
平板石构成一个极妙的火炉。炉里的烟很容易地通到狭缝外边去，烟囱拔着火，不一会儿，“石窟”里就温暖舒适了。
现在他们必须十分小心不让篝火熄灭，永远要留一些红火炭。他们有大量的木柴，而且随时可以补充新的燃料，因此只要随时注意就行了。
潘克洛夫首先就想利用炉火做一顿比生蛤蜊富于营养的晚餐。赫伯特拿了两打蛋来。通讯记者倚在一个角落里，一言不发地瞧着他们做饭。他脑子里旋绕着三个问题。赛勒斯还活着吗？要是还活着，那么他在什么地方呢？如果没有摔死，怎么他没有想法子表示他还在这儿呢？这时纳布在海滩上独自徘徊。他简直象丢了魂似的。
潘克洛夫知道五十种做蛋的方法，但是这一回却不能由他任意选择了，他只能把蛋焖在火灰里。五六分钟以后饭就做得了，水手把通讯记者喊过来吃他的那一份晚餐。这就是遇难的人在这无名的海岸上吃到的第一顿美味。焖蛋非常好吃，加上蛋里含有人们不可缺少的各种养料，于是这些可怜的人感到心满意足，吃了以后也觉得有精神了。要是吃一顿团圆饭该多好啊！如果从里士满逃出来的五个人一个也不少，都坐在“石窟”的干沙地上，围在噼啪作响的旺盛的篝火前，他们会怎样感谢上苍啊！然而他们一致公认的领袖，最博学多才的赛勒斯•史密斯竟失踪了！他死后连个坟地也没有。
3月25日就这样过去了。夜色已经来临。洞外狂风怒号，惊涛拍岸，发出单调的声音。波涛来回卷刷沙石，发出震耳欲聋的巨响。
通讯记者简短地记录了当天的遭遇，他记下了对这片新土地的初步印象，他们领袖的失踪，探索海岸和生火的事情等等。由于过度疲劳，同时也打算用睡眠来忘掉心头的忧愁，于是他退到一个黑暗的角落去。赫伯特一躺下就睡着了。水手整夜在睡梦中都惦记着篝火，他毫不吝啬地大量加添燃料。但是有一个遇难的人没有睡在“石窟”里，那就是伤心绝望的纳布。不管伙伴们怎么劝他休息，他还是整夜在海滨徘徊，呼唤他的主人。
Book 1 Chapter 6
The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon made out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at the time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and a watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they had thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes of Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked on Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in such absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some things were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the first necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a utensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.
And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must hope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect nothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never abandons those whose faith is sincere.
But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast, without trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was inhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?
It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest possible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take. However, according to Pencroft's advice, it appeared best to wait a few days before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some provisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs. The explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all recruit their strength.
The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy to kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the summit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees of the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly, the sweet water was there.
It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along the shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the catastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus Harding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a few hundred feet from a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the body of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes, touched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe in his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him, he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was like the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried, and his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him.
This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on the shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot where the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.
That day's breakfast was composed solely of pigeon's eggs and lithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the hollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.
The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to hunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should remain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable event of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.
"To the chase, Herbert," said the sailor. "We shall find ammunition on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest." But at the moment of starting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would perhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance.
"What?" asked Pencroft.
"Burnt linen," replied the boy. "That could in case of need serve for tinder."
The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the inconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief. Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of Pencroft's large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of a half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all wind and damp.
It was nine o'clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of the river.
Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert rubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!
The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank. From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over which the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose themselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would always lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had to break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the broken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the underwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to wander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition and nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground, which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached the river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the underwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of their roots.
It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not recognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert's opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a human foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on any land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little, for the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and after walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile. As yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described, in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a metallic brilliancy.
"That must be a jacamar," said Herbert, trying to get nearer.
"This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar," replied the sailor, "if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!"
Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and disappeared in an instant.
"How clumsy I am!" cried Herbert.
"No, no, my boy!" replied the sailor. "The blow was well aimed; many a one would have missed it altogether! Come, don't be vexed with yourself. We shall catch it another day!"
As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in vain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many ways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in the Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae, such as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and splendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.
At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage, with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down. Herbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after having examined them,--
"These are couroucous," said he.
"I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl," replied Pencroft, "still, if they are good to eat--"
"They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate," replied Herbert. "Besides, if I don't mistake, it is easy to approach and kill them with a stick."
The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot of a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their nourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender twigs which supported them.
The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away, and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were already heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to fly.
"Well," said Pencroft, "here is game, which is quite within the reach of hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!"
The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs, they then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend towards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the river must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the melting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone.
The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of the Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not been attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he exclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize fled into the long grass, "If only we had had the dog Top!" But Top had disappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished with him.
Towards three o'clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain trees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the juniper- tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded through the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the United States. They soon saw several couples, whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail of the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like appendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at least one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose flesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they would not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor said to the lad,--
"Decidedly, since we can't kill them on the wing, we must try to take them with a line."
"Like a fish?" cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.
"Like a fish," replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would have used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather doubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened one to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong thorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia bush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large red worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.
This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind a large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be said, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive Pencroft.
A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the ground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters, who, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae.
The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.
Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice of them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the worms had been still alive.
The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the hooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft "struck" his line, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.
"Hurrah!" he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself master in an instant.
Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention.
"And at any rate," added he, "situated as we are, we must hope to hit upon many other contrivances."
The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not having to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their dwelling.
The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only to follow, and, towards six o'clock, tired enough with their excursion, Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.
遇难的人从云端掉在这片似乎没有人烟的海岸上以后，很快就清点了一下他们的全部物品。这时，除去随身衣服之外，他们什么也没有了。然而必须说明，吉丁•史佩莱还有一个笔记本和一只表，那无疑是因为疏忽才保留下来的。他们没有武器，没有工具，甚至连一把小刀都没有。在吊篮里的时候，为了减轻气球的重量，他们把所有的东西都扔出去了。就连但尼尔•笛福和魏斯的小说中想象的主人公以及在约翰斐南得群岛和奥克兰群岛航海遇难的赛尔寇克和雷纳，也决不象他们这样一无所有。那些人不是在搁浅的船上得到大量的物资——粮食、家畜、工具和弹药，就是在海滨找到生活必需品。但是这里却没有任何工具和家具。他们只好赤手空拳给自己创造一切。
可是，如果赛勒斯•史密斯和他们在一起，如果工程师利用他的实用科学，针对着他们的情况开动脑筋，发挥创造天才，也许还不至于一筹莫展。然而他们今生再也不用想看见赛勒斯•史密斯了！这些遇难的人只能把希望寄托在自己身上，但愿上天不负有心人，此外再没有别的指望了。这一带海岸属于哪个大陆，有没有人，他们所在的地方是不是一个荒岛，他们能不想个法子调查清楚就这样定居下来吗？
这是一个重要的问题，必须毫不延迟地尽快解决，弄清了这个问题以后，他们就可以决定下一步该怎么做了。然而，按照潘克洛夫的意见，最好还是过几天再开始探索。他们必须准备一些干粮，找些比鸽蛋和软体动物更好的食物，在进行新的繁重工作以前，探险的人首先必须恢复体力。
“石窟”暂时还足够用来安身。篝火生起来了，保留一些炭火也很容易。石缝里有的是鸽蛋，海滩上有大量的蛤蜊。高地上有成千成百的野鸽子在盘旋，不论用棍子或石头都很容易打下几只来。邻近的森林里也可能有可以食用的果子。最后的一个有利条件是：附近有淡水。
他们决定在“石窟”里暂住几天，做好准备，然后或是沿着海岸，或是深入内陆去探险。纳布特别同意这个计划。他的思想和预感都坚持不变，他不想离开出事的海岸。他不相信，可以说不愿意相信赛勒斯•史密斯已经死了。不，他认为象史密斯那样的人决不会糊里糊涂地死去，决不能被海浪卷走，在离岸不过几百英尺的海滨淹死。除非海浪把工程师的尸体冲到岸上来，让他亲眼看见、亲手摸到他主人的尸体，要不然他是决不相信他的主人已经死去的！这个念头好象在他心里扎了根，愈来愈坚定了。也许这是一种幻想，但却是值得尊重的幻想，所以水手也不愿意说破。水手自己固然已经不抱什么希望，然而他知道和纳布争辩也没有用。纳布正象一条在主人的坟旁流连不去的狗，他哀恸得几乎活不下去了。
就在同一天，3月26日的清晨，纳布沿着海岸向北走去，他到了出事的海滨，他记得很清楚，不幸的史密斯就是在这个地方失踪的。
那天早上他们吃的完全是鸽蛋和茨蟹。赫伯特在石头凹处找到一些海水蒸发以后留下来的盐，这种矿物来得正是时候。
吃完饭以后，潘克洛夫问通讯记者愿不愿陪他和赫伯特一起到森林里去打猎。考虑的结果，他们认为必须留一个人在洞里照顾篝火，再说，虽然纳布找到史密斯的可能性很小，也需要有一个人在近处准备帮助他。于是通讯记者就留在家里了。
“赫伯特，我们去打猎的时候，要在路上找些猎具，在森林里弄些武器。”水手说。但是临出发的时候，赫伯特却提出另一件事情，他说，既然没有火绒，最好还是找一些代用品。
“找什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“焦布，”孩子回答说，“也许可以拿它当火绒使用。”
水手觉得这个办法很好。不过这样就必须牺牲一块手帕了。然而这还是值得的，于是潘克洛夫就从他那大花格子的手帕上撕下一块来，马上烤成一块半焦的破布。
他们就把这块容易引火的焦布放在石洞中堂的一个小窟窿的深处，免得遭到风吹和受潮。
早上九点钟，天气阴沉沉的，刮着东南风。赫伯特和潘克洛夫绕过“石窟”的拐弯处，不时看看那缕从石尖顶处袅袅上升的轻烟。他们向河的左岸走去。
进了树林，潘克洛夫首先就从一棵树上扳下两大根粗树枝来，做成棍子，赫伯特又在石头上把棍子的两头磨尖。要是能有一把刀子，他们一定会不借任何代价去换取！
这两个猎人沿着河岸在深草里向前走。河身拐了一个弯向西南流去，再往上河床渐渐狭窄了，两岸很高，上面的树枝搭在一起形成一座拱门。为了不致迷失方向，潘克洛夫决定沿河往前走，这样他们随时都能回到原出发点。但是岸上的障碍太多：有些地方柔韧的树枝低拂水面，有些地方他们又必须用棍子在荆棘和爬藤之间开路，赫伯特在树桩间跑来跑去，灵巧得象一只小猫，在矮树丛中一下子就不见了。一遇这类情况潘克洛夫马上就把他叫回来，央告他不要走失。同时水手留神观察着周围的风土和地势。河的左岸平坦而多沼泽，渐渐地向内陆平缓地高升上去。从这里看起来象是一片水网，无疑地，这些水都从地下泉眼直通到河里。有些矮树丛中也有不费事就可以渡过的小溪流。河的对岸更加崎岖不平，河水流过的一条峡谷地带显得分外突出。一座小山，上面长着层层叠叠的树木象一层帘子似的挡住了视线。在河的右岸行走一定很困难，因为这里地势很陡，弯向水面的树木全靠它们的根部牵扯着。
不用说，这片森林和他们已经视察过的海岸一样，都是人迹没有到过的地方。潘克洛夫只发现了兽类的脚印，动物新近遗留下来的脚印，但是他不知道那究竟是些什么动物；赫伯特认为其中有的是凶猛的野兽留下来的，这些野兽当然会给他们带来一些麻烦；然而他们并没有发现树上有斧子砍过的痕迹，也没有篝火的余烬，更没有人类的脚印。这倒是值得他们庆幸的，要知道在太平洋的任何一个岛屿上，都是有人反比没人更可怕。由于走起来困难重重，前进得很慢，赫伯特和潘克洛夫顾不得谈话了。出发一个钟头以后，才勉强走了一英里多路。到目前为止，打猎还没有一点收获。还好，树枝间有小鸟在乱飞乱叫，显得非常胆小，似乎看见了人，才懂得害怕了。在森林的一片沼泽地带，赫伯特看见一种类似鱼狗的鸟，长着又长又尖的嘴，虽然羽毛发出金属般的光泽，但是并不美丽。
“那一定是啄木鸟，”赫伯特一面说，一面打算走近些。
“这一回可有机会尝尝啄木鸟的肉啦，”水手说，“看它是不是愿意让我们烤一烤！”
正在说着话，赫伯特巧妙地抛出一块石头，打着了啄木鸟的翅膀，但是并没有把它打倒，一转眼它就逃得无影无踪了。
“我的手法真太不高明了！”赫伯特喊道。
“不，不，孩子！”水手说，“你扔得很准；别人恐怕连打都打不着呢！来吧，不要泄气。早晚我们能捉住它的！”
猎人们继续往前走，树木愈来愈稀疏了，有很多树看起来很美丽，但结的果子都不能吃。潘克洛夫找来找去也没有找到日常生活中用途很广的棕榈树；这种树在北半球一直到北纬40度还有，但是在南半球却只分布到南纬35度。这片森林里只有松柏科的树木，赫伯特已经认出来的有：喜马拉雅杉，类似北美洲西北部的那种洋松，和高达一百五十英尺的大枞树。
这时忽然飞来一群美丽的小鸟，长着光彩的长尾巴，它们东一个西一个地停在树枝上，身子一抖羽毛就纷纷落下来，地面上好象铺上了一层上等的鸭绒。赫伯特捡起几根羽毛，看了一会儿，然后说：
“这是锦鸡。”
“我还是喜欢松鸡和珍珠鸡，”潘克洛夫说，“可是假如好吃的话……”
“锦鸡很好吃，它们的肉很嫩，”赫伯特回答说。“还有，如果我没有记错，这种鸟不怕人，我们可以走近去用棍子把它们打死。”
水手和少年从草丛里爬到一棵树底下，这棵树靠近地面的树枝上歇满了锦鸡。它们专等着吃爬过的昆虫，因为它们就靠吃小虫过活。这些鸟用它们的毛爪攀着小树枝，停在树上。
猎人们站起身来，他们的棍子象镰刀割草似的把它们一连串地从树上打下来，这些锦鸡一点也不想飞走，呆呆地任凭人们把它们打落在地上。等到剩下的锦鸡要飞走的时候，地面上已经堆了一百只左右了。
“好，”潘克洛夫说，“这种野禽倒很适合我们这种猎户。只要伸手就可以拿到它们！”
水手用柔韧的细枝把它们穿成串，仿佛是一行飞行的云雀。穿好以后，他们继续前进。河流在这里向南转了一个弯，但是这个弯大概不会延长多远，因为河源一定就在前面的深山里，河水是由主峰的积雪融汇而成的。
他们远征的主要目的已经说过了，是要多找一些野味供给“石窟”里的居民吃。必须承认，到现在为止这个目的还没有达到。因此水手积极地继续向前搜索。忽然有一只动物跑到草丛里去了，他没来得及看清是什么东西，不禁喊道：“假如托普在这儿多好啊！”然而托普和它的主人同时失踪，大概他们是死在一处了。
将近三点钟的时候，树林间又飞来了另外一群鸟，它们在林中的杜松上啄食芳香的松子。突然森林里传出喇叭似的一阵长鸣。这种奇怪而响亮的鸣叫是由美国常见的一种带颈羽的松鸡发出来的。他们很快就看到好几对，这些松鸡有着鲜艳的栗色羽毛，中间点缀着深褐色的斑点，尾巴的颜色也是一样。有几只松鸡脖子上有两片象翅膀似的肉瓣，赫怕特认得这是公的。这种鹑鸡类的动物大小跟普通鸡差不多，而肉味却比笋鸡还要鲜美，潘克洛夫打定主意至少要捉一只。然而要想捉到它们却很困难，因为这种松鸡不容易接近。试了几次，一只也没有捉到，只是把它们吓得一阵乱飞。于是水手对赫伯特说：
“既然它们会飞，逮不着它们，我们就只好用绳子来钓了。”
“象钓鱼似的钓松鸡吗？”赫伯特听了这个提议以后，惊讶地喊道。
“是的。”潘克洛夫一本正经地回答说。他已经在草丛里发现了六个松鸡窝，每个窝里有三四个蛋。水手十分小心地不把鸡窝弄坏，他知道松鸡一定会回来的。他就打算在这些窝的旁边布置绳索——不是圈套，而是真正的钓丝。他把赫伯特带到离鸡窝几步远的地方，在那里小心地安排了一套奇特的装置，这只有依萨克•华尔顿的门徒才会使用。赫伯特很感兴趣地看着他工作，但是还不大相信他能成功。钓丝是用细爬藤接起来的，每根长十五到二十英尺，潘克洛夫从一棵矮小的刺槐上把粗大结实的倒刺扳下来，绑在爬藤的一头当作钩子。把在地面上爬动的大红毛虫当做钓饵。
安排完毕，潘克洛夫悄悄地从深草里走过去，把绳子带钩的一端放在鸡窝附近，然后拿着绳子的另一端走回原处，和赫伯特一起藏在一棵大树后面，他们耐心地在那里等待着。必须说明，赫伯特觉得潘克洛夫的这个发明是不见得能够成功的。
整整过了半个钟头，还没有动静，又过了一会，果然不出水手所料，有好几对松鸡回到窝里来了。它们一面走，一面在地上找东西吃，毫不怀疑附近有猎人，原来猎人考虑得周密，躲到下风去了。
这时赫伯特觉得非常有趣，他屏住了气。潘克洛夫瞪着两眼，张着大嘴，撅着嘴唇，好象正要吃松鸡肉似的，几乎连气也不敢出。
这时候，松鸡在钩子附近走来走去，丝毫没有注意地上的钓饵。于是潘克洛夫轻轻地拉了几下绳子，钓饵微微一动，虫子就好象还活着似的。
水手心里显然比钓鱼的人着急得多，因为钓鱼的人看不见水里的鱼。绳子一动，松鸡就被吸引过来了，它们用嘴啄食钩子上的食饵。几乎是同时，有三只贪吃的松鸡，连虫带钩地把食饵吞了下去。潘克洛夫敏捷地把绳子巧妙地一抖，三只松鸡扑着翅膀被钩住了。
“哈哈！”他一面喊，一面向野禽跑去，马上把它们捉住。
赫伯特高兴得直鼓掌，他还是第一次看见用绳子钓鸟，但是水手却很谦虚地说，这在他已经不是创举了，而且发明的荣誉也不属于他。
“不管怎么说，”他补充道，“在目前的情况下，我们必须多找些窍门。”
他们用绳子绑住松鸡的爪子。潘克洛夫很高兴，现在不至于空手回去见他们的伙伴了，加上天色已晚，他认为最好马上就回去。
河流就是他们的方向，他们只要循着河走就行，将近六点钟的时候，赫伯特和潘克洛夫筋疲力尽地回到了“石窟”。
Book 1 Chapter 7
Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed, gazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in a thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith. The wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day. The whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a violent storm were clearly visible.
Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter. The latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.
"We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!" said the sailor: "Petrels delight in wind and rain."
The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words were,--
"At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the waves carried off our companion?"
The sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and replied,--
"Two cables lengths at the most."
"But what is a cable's length?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet."
"Then," said the reporter, "Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve hundred feet at the most from the shore?"
"About that," replied Pencroft.
"And his dog also?"
"Also."
"What astonishes me," rejoined the reporter, "while admitting that our companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the shore!"
"It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea," replied the sailor. "Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down the coast."
"Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?" again asked the reporter.
"That is my opinion."
"My own opinion," said Gideon Spilett, "with due deference to your experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something unaccountable and unlikely."
"I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett," replied Pencroft; "unhappily, my mind is made up on this point." Having said this, the sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth. Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a bright light into the darkest parts of the passage.
Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get up their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day, but they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick, and roasting before a blazing fire.
At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met with an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had been driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different conclusions from this absence. According to him, Neb's delay was caused by some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search. Also, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had Neb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found some mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path. Perhaps he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was near his master.
Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther than the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.
Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times manifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day, Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.
Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor's opinion that it was best not to divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large tears fell from his eyes.
The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.
Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over the coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was dashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if poured out in cart- loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as it were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united attack insupportable. Between the river's mouth and the end of the cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and rendering them uninhabitable.
Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away, and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.
At eight o'clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have taken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it was impossible.
The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent, and Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very hungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction.
Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the sailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.
Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength, until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond to this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are above all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to their fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.
Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could feel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and that their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of stones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on to the beach. A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys, or flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice the sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so as to take a look in safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be feared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned to his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the ashes.
Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest, the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last took possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to anything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached himself with not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not abandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not cease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why had Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely giving a thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his eyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought reopened them almost immediately.
Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning, when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.
"What's the matter?" he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen.
The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,--
"Listen, Pencroft, listen!"
The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those caused by the storm.
"It is the wind," said he.
"No," replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, "I thought I heard--"
"What?"
"The barking of a dog!"
"A dog!" cried Pencroft, springing up.
"Yes--barking--"
"It's not possible!" replied the sailor. "And besides, how, in the roaring of the storm--"
"Stop--listen--" said the reporter.
Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during a lull, distant barking.
"Well!" said the reporter, pressing the sailor's hand.
"Yes--yes!" replied Pencroft.
"It is Top! It is Top!" cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in getting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and could only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked about, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky, the land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was visible.
The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes, overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.
Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they found must be at some distance.
It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made his way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the reporter's hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which signified "Wait!" then he reentered the passage.
An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the darkness, whistling shrilly.
It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking immediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage. Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.
An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted up with a bright flame.
"It is Top!" cried Herbert.
It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the engineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master accompanied him!
How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys, which he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the midst of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even soiled with mud or sand!--Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad's hands.
"If the dog is found, the master will be found also!" said the reporter.
"God grant it!" responded Herbert. "Let us set off! Top will guide us!"
Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top's arrival contradicted his conjectures. "Come along then!" said he.
Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return. Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to come with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out, after having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.
The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow a straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top's instinct. They did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the sailor brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The rain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.
However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The wind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of sand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received behind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they sometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in keeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at random that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that Neb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog. But was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions that they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate Harding?
After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an hour.
They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having pronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as much as to say that his master was saved.
"Saved, isn't he?" repeated Herbert; "saved, Top?"
And the dog barked in reply.
They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows thundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed entirely over the islet, then quite invisible. The mole no longer protected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the open sea.
As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind struck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what direction to take.
They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their right a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess. But they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed completely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came in contact with the cliff.
At four o'clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared about five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though less damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their clothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not a complaint escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top, wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.
Towards five o'clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog was less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a luminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the same time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though very indistinctly.
At six o'clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were following a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left, the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling with thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance to the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two or three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in that direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of the forest.
At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned, and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least hesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The country appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be seen.
The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks and even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a Switzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have possibly recognized the way.
Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of a high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.
Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.
The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.
吉丁•史佩莱站在海边，两臂交叉在胸前，一动也不动地凝视着大海，东方的水平线上遮着一层层浓厚的乌云，它飞快地往头顶上扩张开来。风已经很大，随着夜色的降临，天变得更冷了。天空呈现出一幅险恶的景象，可以清楚地看出，这是暴风雨的前奏。
赫伯特进了“石窟”，潘克洛夫向通讯记者走去。史佩莱正在出神，没有发现有人向自己走来。
“今天晚上恐怕要起暴风了，史佩莱先生，海燕是喜欢暴风雨的。”
这时候通讯记者转过身，他看见潘克洛夫，第一句话就说：
“你记得海浪把我们的伙伴卷走的时候气球离海岸有多远？”
水手没有想到他会问这个。他想了一会，然后答道：
“至多两锚链。”
“一锚链有多长？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“大约有一百二十寻，也就是二百米的光景。”
“那么，”通讯记者说，“赛勒斯•史密斯失踪的地方离岸至多不过四百米？”
“差不多。”潘克洛夫说。
“他的狗也是在那里失踪的吗？”
“是的。”
“我认为奇怪的是，”通讯记者接着说，“假如说是我们的伙伴死了，托普也淹死了，难道狗和它主人的尸体都冲不到岸上来吗？”
“这一点也不奇怪，海里的风浪这么大，”水手答道。“而且海水也可能把他们带到更远的地方去的。”
“那么，你认为我们的朋友已经死在海里了吗？”通讯记者又问道。
“我认为是这样。”
“潘克洛夫，你的经验我当然佩服，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“现在不管他们是不些是真死了，我总觉得在赛勒斯和托普一起失踪的这件事情上，有地方是没法解释和不合情理的。”
“我也希望我能跟你一样想，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫答道。“可惜的是，在这个问题上我的想法已经肯定了。”水手说完，就回“石窟”去了。炉架上噼噼啪啪地燃烧着烈火。赫伯特刚扔了一抱干柴在上面，火焰把通道里最暗的地方都照亮了。
潘克洛夫马上就开始做饭。按理说饭食中最好能增添一些吃得饱的食物，因为他们都需要恢复体力。他们把大串的锦鸡留到第二天，将两只松鸡拔了毛，叉在棍子上，在旺盛的火焰上烤了起来。
晚上七点钟了，纳布还没有回来，这使潘克洛夫非常不安。他们担心这个伤心的人会在这陌生的土地上遇见什么意外，或是因为绝望而自寻短见了。但赫伯特看法完全不同。他认为纳布没有回来是由于发现了新的线索，因此延长了寻找的时间。并且，每一个新的发现都是对赛勒斯•史密斯有利的。假如不是怀着希望，纳布为什么还不回来呢？也许他发现了痕迹，一个脚印，或者是什么残留的东西，因为有这些才把他引对了路。也许他现在正在沿着线索寻找。甚至也许他就在他主人的近旁。
少年这样推测，这样谈出自己的看法。他的同伴们听着他说。通讯记者独自默默地表示同意。然而潘克洛夫认为纳布多半是沿着海岸走得比前一天更远了，还没有来得及回来。
赫伯特不知为什么总是感到坐立不安，他几次表示要出去找纳布。但潘克洛夫跟他说这是没有用处的，在黑暗和阴森森的天气里，不可能找到纳布的踪迹，还不如在家里等他回来。假如到第二天纳布还不回来，潘克洛夫会毫不犹豫地和他一起去找的。
吉丁•史佩莱同意水手的意见，也劝他最好不要再分开，赫伯特只好放弃自己的计划，但是两颗大粒的泪珠却从他的眼睛里滴了下来。
通讯记者不禁将这慷慨侠义的孩子紧紧搂在怀里。
天气变了。一阵狂风从东南方吹来，刮过海滨。奔腾澎湃的海水冲击着礁石。倾盆大雨被暴风吹得和滚滚灰尘一般。岸边笼罩着一团激起的雾气，砾石在风浪的逼迫之下撞击在海岸上，好象成车往外倒似的，发出哗啦啦的巨响。大风飞砂走石，给雨水造成的烟尘里增添了一种矿质的尘土，这两股力量汇合在一起成了一股不可抵挡的力量。旋风在河口和峭壁之间打转，阵阵旋涡抽打着峡谷间的流水。“石窟”里冒出来的烟也被顶回到缝隙里去了，通道里烟气弥漫，呆在里面很不舒服。
因此，等松鸡烧好以后，潘克洛夫就把篝火熄灭了，只留下几块火炭在灰烬里。
已经是晚上八点钟了，纳布还没有回来。毫无疑问，是可怕的天气把他阻拦在外边了。他一定已经找到藏身的洞穴，打算等到暴风雨停了以后，或者至少是等到第二天再回来，现在要想去接他，或是打算把他找回来是不可能的。
晚餐吃的是猎得的野味；松鸡肉非常鲜美，潘克洛夫和赫伯特打猎累了一天，肚子很饿，更是吃得津津有味。
晚饭以后，大家都睡到前一晚自己所占的角落里去；水手四仰八叉地躺在靠火的地方，赫伯特在他身旁很快就睡着了。
夜渐深，外面的风雨也愈紧，还记得那天把这群俘虏从里士满带到太平洋岛屿上来的情况吧，最后就变得跟那天差不多了，暴风雨在春秋雨季特别频繁，经常酿成巨灾，在无边天际的海洋上，什么也阻拦不住它，因此尤其可怕，一个毫无屏障的东海岸在这种可怕的狂风袭击下的惨象是难以形容的。
幸而堆成“石窟”的岩石是很牢固的。这是些巨大的花岗石堆成的“石窟”，有几座不怎么牢固，风吹过来好象连地基都晃动了。潘克洛夫枕在岩石上，可以感觉到它们在自己的头底下频频震动。他一再安慰自己——正正经经地安慰自己——不必害怕，他们的避难所是不会倒塌的。可是他也听见高地的顶上有石头被风刮走，掉在海滩上，有几块甚至落在“石窟”的顶上，有的被垂直卷起来，裂成小块往外飞射出去。水手两次爬起身来，一面借着通道入口的地方挡着身子保住自己的安全，一面往外看。雨并没有什么了不起，可以不必害怕，于是他就回到篝火前的铺上，火炭还在灰烬中爆裂作响。
虽然外面风雨在咆哮，雷声隆隆，但赫伯特还是睡得很熟。最后潘克洛夫也困了，航海的生涯使他对什么都习惯了。只有吉丁•史佩莱焦急得睡不着觉。他埋怨自己没有陪纳布一块儿去。显然史佩莱还没有放弃一切的希望。使赫伯特心神不宁的预感同样也使他放心不下。他满脑子想的都是纳布。为什么纳布没有回来呢？他躺在沙地上翻来复去，几乎完全不理会外面的狂风暴雨，他有时合上沉重的眼皮，但仅仅是一会儿，往往又突然想到什么立刻重新睁开。
夜色已经深沉了，大约在第二天早上两点钟的时候，正在酣睡的潘克洛夫突然被推醒了。
“怎么回事？”他醒过来喊道，同时马上恢复了他的神志。这是一般水手所独具的本领。
通讯记者在他上面俯着身子说：
“听，潘克洛夫，听！”
水手竖起耳朵，但是除了外边的风雨声之外，听不见其他什么响动。
“那是风。”他说。
“不，”吉丁•史佩莱答道，他又听了一会，“我好象听见……”
“什么？”
“狗叫的声音！”
“狗！”潘克洛夫跳起来喊道。
“是的……狗叫……”
“不可能！”水手说。“并且，在暴风雨里怎么……”
“别说话……听……”通讯记者说。
潘克洛夫又仔细听了一会儿，果然在风雨间歇的时候，听见远处好象有狗叫的声音。
“是不是？”通讯记者紧紧地握住潘克洛夫的手说。
“是……是的！”水手答道。
“是托普！是托普！”赫伯特一醒来就喊道。于是三个人一起向“石窟”的洞口冲去。他们想出去却非常困难。大风把他们吹得倒退。最后终于出去了，但是只能一动也不动地倚在岩石上。他们四面张望了一下，然而没法开口说话。夜色非常昏暗。海洋、天空和陆地都变成漆黑的一片。连一丝亮光都看不见。
通讯记者和他的伙伴们就这样站了几分钟，他们在狂风中毫无办法，浑身都被雨打湿了，眼睛让风沙迷得睁不开。
在暴风雨稍微停歇的时候，又听见狗叫了，他们断定声音的来源离这里还相当远。
一定是托普！然而它是孤零零的还是有人和它在一起呢？多半是孤零零的，假如纳布和它在一起，它一定能够往“石窟”来。潘克洛夫没法使别人听见他的话，就捏了一下通讯记者的手，意思是叫他“等一会儿！”然后水手就回到“石窟”里去了。
工夫不大，他拿了一束点着的干柴跑出来，把它扔在黑暗里，同时吹起了尖声的口哨。
好象远处就在等这个信号似的，狗叫声立刻接近了。不久以后，一只狗跑着跳着到通道里来。潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱都跟着它跑了进去。
火炭上加一把干柴，通道被照亮了。
“是托普！”赫伯特喊道。
果然是托普，它是一只美丽的盎格鲁——诺尔曼杂种狗，由于具有这两个品种的特点，它跑得既快，嗅觉又灵。猎狗特别需要具备这种优点。这正是工程师赛勒斯•史密斯的狗。但它是孤零零的！纳布和它的主人都没有和它在一起！
托普并不知道这里有个“石窟”，它的直觉怎么会把它直接带到这儿来的呢？这似乎是不可思议的，特别是在这茫茫的黑夜里，在这样的暴风雨中！更奇怪的是：托普显得既不疲倦，又不劳累，甚至身上连一点烂泥也没有！……赫伯特已经把它拉到自己的身旁来，拍着它的头，托普用它的脖子来回磨擦着少年的手。
“狗找到了，它的主人还能找不到吗？”通讯记者说。
“但愿上天保佑！”赫伯特说。“我们去找吧！托普会领路的！”
潘克洛夫没有表示反对。托普回来是出乎他的意料之外的。他说：“那么走吧！”
潘克洛夫仔细盖上灰堆里的火炭，又添了几块木柴在里面，使篝火能一直维持到他们回来。托普发着短促的叫声，好象要大家跟着它走似的。于是潘克洛夫用手帕把剩余的晚餐包起来带在身上，随着狗向外冲去，他的后面紧跟着通讯记者和少年。
这时候风雨正急，也许正在威力最大的时候。云端里没有丝毫月光透出来。要想直线前进是很困难的。最好还是跟着托普走。他们就这样做了。通讯记者和赫伯特紧跟着托普，水手走在最后。要想说话是不可能的。雨并不太大，然而风势非常猛烈。
但是有一点对水手和他的两个伙伴是有利的。这时刮的是东南风，正吹在他们的背后。大风在他们的身后扬起烟尘，但对于他们的前进毫无阻碍，如果风沙迎面扑来，那就没法抵挡了。一句话，他们常常不由自主地跑得很快，要想站住脚都不容易，尤其是希望给他们带来了力量。这一次他们并不是漫无目标地沿着海岸前进。他们深信纳布已经找到他的主人，因此才把忠实的托普打发回来喊他们。但是工程师是不是还活着呢？会不会是纳布喊他的伙伴们来一起给不幸的史密斯料理后事呢？
走过悬崖以后，赫伯特、通讯记者和潘克洛夫都小心地站在一旁，停下来喘息。岩石的转角有一个能避风的地方，经过这一番劳累——也就是十五分钟的奔跑——他们可以在这里歇一口气了。
现在他们彼此已能听见对方的话，而且也能够张嘴回答了。少年刚提到赛勒斯•史密斯，托普就发出几声急促的叫喊，好象是说，它的主人得救了。
“他得救了吗？”赫伯特反复地问，“得救了吗？托普？”
它叫了几声，表示回答。
他们又往前赶了。这时候潮水上涨了，在狂风的推动下，它达到了异乎寻常的惊人高度——这已经是春潮了。滔天的巨浪如同千军万马气势汹汹地奔腾过来，在礁石上撞击得粉碎，潮水大概把整个的小岛都淹没了，当时他们完全看不见它。现在沿岸已经没有长堤保护了，海滨直接遭受着大海的侵袭。
水手和他的伙伴们才离开悬崖，暴风就立刻重新向他们展开了攻势。虽然他们在大风里弯腰前进，但还是跑得很快，托普在前面领着路，方向固定，毫不犹豫。
他们朝着正北在上走去，右边是一片茫茫的大海，波涛在狂风中发出震耳欲聋的声响，左边是一片漆黑的土地，没法想象是什么样子。可是他们觉得那里比较平坦，因为风吹过去毫无阻碍，不象刮到悬崖上那样又折回来。
清晨四点钟的时候，他们估计大约已经走出五英里以外了。阴云稍微上升了一些，风里的水气虽然少了，但还是冰冷刺骨。由于衣服单薄，潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱都冻得受不了，但是他们丝毫也没有诉苦。他们决定跟随着托普，这头机灵的畜生走到哪里，他们就跟到哪里。
将近五点钟，天开始破晓。头顶上的迷雾比较稀薄。阴云的四周镶着一道浅灰色的边缘。在一带晦暗的天空下，一线白光清晰地标志出水平线，浪涛上端闪着动荡不定的亮光，水花又重新变成白色的了。这时候，左边丘陵起伏的海岸开始模糊地显现出来了，但也只是象黑底上的灰点那样难以辨别。
六点钟的时候，天亮了。密云迅速升起，水手和他的伙伴们离开“石窟”大约已经有六英里了。他们沿着一道宽阔的海滩前进，这一带沿海有很多礁石，不过都隐没在很深的海水中，很少露出水面。左边好象是一片广阔的沙丘，长着许多笔直向上的蓟草。这里没有悬崖，面临海洋的地方没有任何屏障，只有一堆堆错综零乱的山石。树木三三两两地丛生着，树身向西倾斜，枝干也朝着这个方向。在西南面的远方，伸展着森林的边缘。
这时候托普变得非常焦急。它跑到前面去，然后又跑回来，好象求他们走得快一些似的。然后它就离开了海岸，神秘的直觉，促使它毫不犹豫地一直在沙丘中走去。他们跟在后面。周围完全象一片沙漠。没有任何生物。
这片沙丘非常广阔，是由许多山石，甚至还有一些小山组成的，分布得很不平均。整个的地形象一个沙上做成的瑞士模型，只有具备惊人的直觉，才不至于迷路。
离开海岸以后五分钟，通讯记者和他的两个伙伴到了一个洞口，这个洞在一座很高的沙丘背后。托普在这里停住了，它一声比一声清楚而响亮地叫起来。史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫向洞里走去。
一个人直着身子躺在草铺上，纳布跪在他的旁边……
躺在那里的正是工程师赛勒斯•史密斯。
Book 1 Chapter 8
Neb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.
"Living?" he cried.
Neb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped his hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his grief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor speak.
The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear to the engineer's chest, having first torn open his clothes.
A minute--an age!--passed, during which he endeavored to catch the faintest throb of the heart.
Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had completely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized, exhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was dead.
Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.
"He lives!" said he.
Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.
Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found, a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly increased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing in which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was obliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream, and with it hastened back to the grotto.
Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only wished to wet the engineer's lips. The cold water produced an almost immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.
"We will save him!" exclaimed the reporter.
At these words hope revived in Neb's heart. He undressed his master to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found, either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the efforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.
But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he would say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this about; so they set to work with the sailor's jersey.
The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly and began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion, and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus Harding.
"You thought your master was dead, didn't you?" said the seaman to Neb.
"Yes! quite dead!" replied Neb, "and if Top had not found you, and brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain down on his grave to die!"
It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!
Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly direction, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already visited.
There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach, among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He examined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by the high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all marks. Neb did not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse that he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!
He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not reached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark, were untouched. Not a shell was broken.
Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point. When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time.
"I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining the beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding anything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on the sand."
"Footprints?" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Yes!" replied Neb.
"Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?" asked the reporter.
"No," replied Neb, "only above high-water mark, for the others must have been washed out by the tide."
"Go on, Neb," said Spilett.
"I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile, running, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top brought me here, to my master!"
Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life. Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his efforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last duties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his companions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again. Top was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal? Neb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his companions whom Top knew best.
Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction indicated to him.
We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost as supernatural, Top had found them.
Neb's companions had listened with great attention to this account.
It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which he must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had not received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was how the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than a mile from the shore.
"So, Neb," said the reporter, "it was not you who brought your master to this place."
"No, it was not I," replied the Negro.
"It's very clear that the captain came here by himself," said Pencroft.
"It is clear in reality," observed Spilett, "but it is not credible!"
The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer's own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had re-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm again, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.
Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear to hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by movement, his senses had not as yet been restored.
Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of procuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt linen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by striking together two flints. As to the engineer's pockets, they were entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch. It was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as possible. This was the opinion of all.
Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back to consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with which they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought of mixing with the water some moisture from the titra's flesh which he had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large bivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced between the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his eyes.
Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.
"My master! my master!" cried Neb.
The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other two companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.
A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even then, troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they were the same words he had before attempted to utter.
"Island or continent?" he murmured.
"Bother the continent," cried Pencroft hastily; "there is time enough to see about that, captain! we don't care for anything, provided you are living."
The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeased to sleep.
They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor could not help repeating,--
"Island or continent! To think of that, when at one's last gasp! What a man!"
Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions set to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its principal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with these branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and leaves, they could carry the engineer.
This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o'clock when they returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.
The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the drowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.
"Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?" asked the reporter.
"Yes," replied the engineer.
"It's my opinion," said the sailor, "that Captain Harding will be able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse jelly,--for we have grouse, captain," added he, presenting him with a little of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.
Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided among his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were suffering extremely from hunger.
"Well!" said the sailor, "there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for you must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house, with rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of birds, which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as soon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home."
"Thanks, my friend," replied the engineer; "wait another hour or two, and then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett."
The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon, the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it was, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys, the search for him, not forgetting of course Neb's devotion, the intelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other matters.
"But," asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, "you did not, then, pick me up on the beach?"
"No," replied the reporter.
"And did you not bring me to this cave?"
"No."
"At what distance is this cave from the sea?"
"About a mile," replied Pencroft; "and if you are astonished, captain, we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!"
"Indeed," said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took great interest in these details, "indeed it is very singular!"
"But," resumed the sailor, "can you tell us what happened after you were carried off by the sea?"
Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him from the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning to the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling near him. It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the balloon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had darted away like an arrow.
There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could not be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle against the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his clothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top with him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he recovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered nothing.
"However," remarked Pencroft, "you must have been thrown on to the beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your footmarks!"
"Yes... of course replied the engineer, thoughtfully; "and you found no traces of human beings on this coast?"
"Not a trace," replied the reporter; "besides, if by chance you had met with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?"
"You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb," added the engineer, turning to his servant, "it was not you who... you can't have had a moment of unconsciousness... during which no, that's absurd.... Do any of the footsteps still remain?" asked Harding.
"Yes, master, replied Neb; "here, at the entrance, at the back of the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has destroyed the others."
"Pencroft," said Cyrus Harding, "will you take my shoe and see if it fits exactly to the footprints?"
The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided by Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus remarked to the reporter,--
"It is a most extraordinary thing!"
"Perfectly inexplicable!" replied Gideon Spilett.
"But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about it by-and-by."
A moment after the others entered.
There was no doubt about it. The engineer's shoe fitted exactly to the footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.
"Come," said he, "I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having dragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!"
The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were lavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of the affair.
Towards twelve o'clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which exhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on the sailor, or he would have fallen.
"Well done!" cried Pencroft; "bring the captain's litter."
The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with leaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having taken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards the coast. There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but, as they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop frequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach the Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not rain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed the coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no doubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground, its forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind. However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he slept.
At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short time after at the Chimneys.
They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was sleeping profoundly, and did not awake.
Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had quite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred; great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing over the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous curtain of granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away by the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across Pencroft's mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned almost immediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions.... The fire was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was to have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had penetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and destroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!
纳布一动也不动，潘克洛夫只问了一句：
“还活着吗？”
纳布没有回答，史佩莱和水手的脸色都变了。赫伯特紧握着双手，呆呆地站在那里。可怜的黑人由于伤心过度，显然既没有看见他的伙伴，又没有听见水手的话。
通讯记者跪到赛勒斯•史密斯僵卧着的身体旁边，解开他的衣服，然后把耳朵凑在他的胸前。
一分钟就好比一世纪那么长！好容易一分钟过去了，这时，他努力倾听着极其微弱的心脏跳动声。
纳布微微挺直了身子，两眼发直，却什么也没有看见。由于悲伤过度，他的面容已经完全改变了，人们几乎已认不出他了。他以为他的主人已经死了。
经过很长时间的仔细检查以后，吉丁•史佩莱终于站起身来。
“还活着呢！”他说。
潘克洛夫紧跟着也跪到工程师的旁边来，他也听到一阵心跳声，甚至唇边还觉得出有一丝呼吸。
赫伯特一听见通讯记者的话就出去找水。他在一百英尺以外发现一条清澈的小溪，大概是由于下雨的缘故，水上涨了，溪里的沙粒把流水滤得非常干净。但是赫伯特找不到盛水的器具，沙丘上连一枚贝壳也没有。少年想不出什么办法，只好把他的手帕浸在小溪里，然后急急忙忙地跑回山洞去。
幸亏湿手帕足够吉丁•史佩莱应用的了，他只想使工程师的嘴唇湿润一下，冷水几乎立刻发生了奇效。史密斯的胸部吐出一口气，似乎想说话。
“我们一定要救活他！”通讯记者大声说。
纳布听了这话，又产生了一线希望，他解开主人的衣服，查看他受伤没有；他的头上、身上和四肢一点伤痕也没有，这的确令人奇怪。原来认为他一定是摔在乱石丛中，然后才挣扎到波浪达不到的地方，但是居然不留任何痕迹，甚至连手上都没有伤，这是道理上说不过去的。
不过他们不久就可以得到解答。等到赛勒斯能够说话的时候，他就会把经过谈出来了。目前的问题是怎样把他救醒过来，看样子用按摩的方法可以达到这个目的，于是他们就用水手的绒衣进行按摩。
经过一阵剧烈的按摩，工程师苏醒过来了，他微微动了动胳膊，呼吸也逐渐正常起来。他由于精力耗尽而陷于瘫痪状态，肯定他说，假如不是通讯记者和他的伙伴们及时赶来的话，赛勒斯•史密斯就不可能活过来了。
“你以为你的主人死了，是吗？”水手对纳布说。
“是的，我认为是死了！”纳布答道，“要不是托普找到你们，把你们领到这儿来，我就要把主人埋起来，然后死在他的坟上了！”
赛勒斯•史密斯真是死里逃生！
于是纳布叙述了经过的情况。前一天黎明的时候，他就离开了“石窟”，爬上海滨高处往北走去，一直走到他曾经去过的那一带海岸。
纳布并没有对那里抱什么希望，他在海岸上、岩石里和沙滩上寻找，只不过想得到哪怕是一点线索，他特别注意潮水冲不到的海滩，因为靠海的一带潮水是会把所有的痕迹都冲刷掉的。纳布并没想把他活着的主人找回来。他只想找到主人的遗骸，能够亲手埋葬他！
他找了很久还是没有结果。这片荒凉的海岸上好象从来也不曾有过人迹。成千上万的贝壳散布在海水冲不到的满潮线上，没有一个看来象有人碰过，个个都是完整的。
于是纳布决定沿着海滨再走几英里。可能海水把尸体冲到相当远的地方去了。一般说来，如果海岸是较低的，而尸体就在不远的海面漂浮的话，那是迟早总会被潮水抛到岸上来的。纳布知道这一点，他想和他的主人见最后的一面。
“我又沿着海滨走了两英里，不论是水浅处的岩礁还是水高处的沙岸，我都仔细地观察了。最后我认为不可能找到什么东西，已经绝望了，可是就在昨天傍晚大约五点钟的时候，我在沙滩上发现许多脚印。”
“脚印？”潘克洛夫喊道。
“是的！”纳布说。
“这些脚印是从水边开始的吗？”通讯记者问道。
“不，”纳布说，“全在满潮线上，其他的一定都被潮水冲掉了。”
“说下去吧，纳布。”史佩莱说。
“我一看见这些脚印简直快乐疯了。脚印非常清楚，一直通到沙丘上去。我跟了四分之一英里，一面跑，一面注意不把它们踩掉。五分钟以后，天渐渐地黑了，我听见狗叫的声音。那就是托普，它一直把我带到这儿，带到主人的身边来！”
纳布最后谈到当他发现这个毫无生气的躯体时心里是多么悲伤，他看来看去也看不出一点活着的样子，起初只想找到主人的尸体，可是等到找着以后，他就进一步希望他活了。但是他费尽了力气也没有用！他没有别的办法，只好对这个最心爱的人尽自己最后的一次责任了！这时纳布想到他的伙伴们。毫无疑问，他们一定也希望再看一眼这个不幸的人。当时托普正在那里，难道他信不过这个忠实畜生的智慧吗？当然不，纳布一再重复着通讯记者的名字——在伙伴们之中，这个名字是托普最熟悉的——然后他指着南方，于是托普就朝着他指的方向跑去了。
托普依靠它那近乎神奇的直觉终于找到了它从来没有到过的“石窟”，找着了他们。
纳布的伙伴们聚精会神地听完了这段经过。
赛勒斯•史密斯一定是跨过重重的岩石，经过一番努力才从海里逃上岸来的，然而他身上却一点伤也没有，这一点他们实在不明白。工程师究竟用什么方法走完这一英里多的路，从海滨来到沙丘的这个山洞里，这一点就更没法解释。
“照这么说，纳布，”通讯记者说，“不是你把他带到这儿来的了？”
“不，不是我。”黑人答道。
“很明显，是他自己到这儿来的。”潘克洛夫说。
“事实固然很明显，”史佩莱说，“但这实在令人难以相信！”
这件事只好等工程师亲自解释了，他们必须等到他能够说话。经过按摩，血液流通了。赛勒斯•史密斯的胳膊又动了一下，接着又动了动头，然后他说了几个字；但是谁也听不清他在说些什么。
纳布弓着身子叫唤工程师，可是工程师好象没有听见，他的眼睛依然紧闭着。只有从他的动作上才看得出他还活着，他还没有完全恢复知觉。
潘克洛夫感到遗憾的是：既没有火，又没有取火的东西，他不幸忘记把焦布带在身上了，要不然用两块火石砸出火星来，就很容易把焦布点着。工程师的口袋里什么也没有，只有坎肩口袋里有一只怀表。现在必须赶快把史密斯抬回“石窟”去，这一点大家的意见完全一致。
在他们大力照护下，工程师开始恢复知觉了，他们都没有想到会这么快。用来湿润嘴唇的水使他逐渐苏醒过来。潘克洛夫想起带在身上的松鸡，他想把鸡肉汁加在水里做饮科。赫伯特还跑到海边去，带了两只大蚌回来。水手调制好饮料以后送到工程师嘴里去，工程师一面贪婪地喝着，一面睁开了眼睛。
纳布和通讯记者正俯伏在他身上。
“主人！主人！”纳布喊道。
工程师听见了，他首先认出纳布和史佩莱，然后认出其余两个伙伴，他无力地握了握他们的手。
他又说了几个字，可以看出即使在这个时候，他的脑子里也在考虑问题。这次大家听懂了。刚才他打算说的无疑也是这句话。
“荒岛还是大陆？”他喃喃地说。
“管他什么大陆荒岛呢？”潘克洛夫情不自禁地喊道，“有的是时间去看，只要你活着，我们什么都不在乎。”
工程师无力地点点头，然后好象睡着了。
他们没有打扰他的睡眠，通讯记者准备马上把史密斯抬到一个比较舒适的地方去。纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫离开山洞，向着一座耸立的小山跑去，小山顶上有几棵东倒西歪的树。一路上水手不由地重复着说：
“‘荒岛还是大陆？’只剩了一口气还在想这个，多么了不起的人啊！”
潘克洛夫和他的两个伙伴爬上小山以后就开始工作了，他们什么工具也没有，只好赤手空拳去扳一棵树的粗枝。这是一棵类似海枞的树，已经相当干枯了，他们打算用这些枝干做担架，上面铺上野草和树叶来抬工程师。
他们一共用了将近四十分钟的时间才把担架做好，在这期间，史佩莱始终没有离开工程师，当他们回来的时候，已经是上午十点钟了。
他们回到洞里发现工程师刚从梦中（或是昏睡状态中）醒来。他的脸色始终象死人那样苍白，直到这时候才逐渐正常。他稍微抬起身来，看看周围，仿佛想知道自己是在什么地方。
“你听我说话不觉得累吗，赛勒斯？”通讯记者问道。
“不累。”工程师说。
“我认为，”水手说，“如果史密斯先生再吃些松鸡冻，那么听起来一定会更省力的。史密斯先生，我们这儿有松鸡。”他一面说，一面把一些肉冻给史密斯吃，他还加了一些肉在里面。
赛勒斯•史密斯只吃了一点松鸡，剩下来的都由伙伴们分着吃了。他们正饿得厉害，这顿早饭对他们说起来未免太少。
“对啦！”水手说，“‘石窟’里有的是吃的东西，你知道，史密斯先生，从这儿出去一直往南，我们有一所房子，里面有房间，有床铺，还生着火，伙食房里有好几打鸟，我们的赫伯特管它们叫什么锦鸡。担架已经给你准备好了，只等你恢复了气力，我们就把你抬回家去。”
“谢谢你，我的朋友，”工程师答道，“再等一两个钟头就走。现在你谈吧，史佩莱。”
于是通讯记者把他们的经历讲了一遍：气球怎样最后一次下坠掉在这沙漠似的陌生土地上（且不管它是荒岛还是大陆）；怎样发现了“石窟”，怎样寻找他，当然也忘不了纳布的一片至诚，忠心的托普的智慧以及其他许多事情。凡是史密斯不知道的他全谈出来了。
“那么，”史密斯用微弱的声音问道，“你们不是在沙滩上把我救起来的吗？”
“没有。”通讯记者答道。
“不是你们把我带到这个洞里来的吗？”
“不是。”
“这个山洞离海有多远？”
“大约半英里，”潘克洛夫答道，“你感到奇怪吗，史密斯先生，我们看见你在这儿才感到奇怪呢！”
“的确，”工程师说，这时候他渐渐复原了，他对这些事情极感兴趣，“真是太奇怪了！”
“可是，”水手接着说，“你能告诉我们你掉在海里以后的情况吗？”
赛勒斯•史密斯沉思起来。他知道得很少。波浪把他从气球网上卷到海里。他起初下沉了几寻深。在往水面上升的时候，他朦朦胧胧觉得有一个活的东西在他身旁挣扎。那就是托普，它是从气球上跳下来救他的。当时气球已经不知去向。因为减少了他和狗的重量，气球就箭也似的飞了上去了。
他就这样掉在这怒潮澎湃的海洋里，这里离海岸至少有半英里。他拼命游泳，打算和波涛作一番斗争。托普咬住他的衣服，使他浮在水面上。但是一股激流向他冲来，把他一直带到北面去，他挣扎了半个钟头以后，就跟托普一起下沉到很深的地方去了。从那时候起，一直到他在朋友的怀抱中醒来，他什么也记不清了。
“不管怎么样，”潘克洛夫说，“你一定是被海水冲上岸的，然后才鼓起余力走到这儿来，因为纳布找到了你的脚印！”
“是的……当然……”工程师若有所思地答道，“你们在海滨上没有发现人迹吗？”
“一点影子也没有，”通讯记者说，“再说，假如真有人在紧要关头碰巧把你救了起来，那么离了大海以后，为什么又把你扔下来呢？”
“你说得对，亲爱的史佩莱。告诉我，纳布，”工程师转过头来对他的仆人说，“不是你……你不会一时失去了知觉……那时候……不，那太离奇了……现在还有脚印留在那里吗？”史密斯问道。
“有的，主人，”纳布说，“这儿，在入口的地方，在小山背后，风雨打不到的地方还有。其余的都被暴风雨冲掉了。”
“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，”请你把我的鞋子拿去比量比量，看看究竟是不是我的脚印，好吗？”
水手按照工程师的话去做了。当纳布带领着他和赫伯特去找脚印的时候，赛勒斯对通讯记者说：
“这件事真是太奇怪了！”
“简直没法理解！”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“现在先别考虑了，亲爱的史佩莱，我们将来再谈吧。”
不一会，纳布和赫伯特进来了。
毫无疑问，工程师的鞋子和脚印完全符合。因此沙滩上的脚印肯定是赛勒斯•史密斯留下的。
“好吧，”他说，“刚才我认为是纳布失去了知觉，照这么说一定是我自己了。我一定象害了梦游病似的，迷迷糊糊地走着，一定是托普把我从海里拖上来，然后把我引到这儿来的……过来，托普！过来，我的狗！”
这头美丽的畜生一面叫，一面跳到它主人的身边来，史密斯尽情地抚摩了它一阵。大家都认为再也没有别的理由可以解释赛勒斯•史密斯的得救了。这件事应该完全归功于托普。
将近十二点钟的时候，潘克洛夫问工程师，他们现在能不能抬他。史密斯没有回答，他表现了坚强的意志，居然努力站起身来。但是他不得不靠在水手身上，要不然他就要跌倒了。
“好！”潘克洛夫说，“把担架抬来。”
担架抬来了，交叉的枝干上铺着野草和树叶。史密斯躺在上面，潘克洛夫和纳布各抬着一头，于是他们就向海滨出发了。这一段距离有八英里。因为他们不能走得很快，而且还要不断地停歇，他们估计至少要六个钟头才能到达“石窟”。风还是很大，幸亏这时候已经不下雨了。工程师躺在担架上，还是用胳膊支持着身子，观察着海岸，特别是内陆。他没有说话，只是睁大两眼看周围的景物，高低不平的地势以及森林和各种物产无疑都在他的脑海里留下了印象，可是走了两个钟头以后，他就感到疲倦而睡着了。
五点半钟的时候，他们经过悬崖下，不久就回到“石窟”了。
他们停了下来，把担架放在沙地上，赛勒斯•史密斯在酣睡中还没有醒来。
可怕的暴风雨使这里的面貌大大改变了。潘克洛夫不由得吃了一惊。这里发生了巨大的变化：海滩上添了很多大石块。上面覆盖着一层厚厚的水草、海藻和其他漂上岸来的水生植物。漫过小岛的海水显然曾经一直冲到巨大的花岗石壁底下。石穴前的泥土已经被汹涌的海浪冲去了。潘克洛夫的脑子里忽然闪过一个可怕的念头。他急忙冲到通道里去，可是几乎马上就回来了。他呆呆地站在那里，眼睛盯着他的伙伴们……火灭了，灰烬被水泡成一滩泥，留着代替火绒的焦布也不见了！海水一直灌到通道的最里面，“石窟”里所有的东西都被冲倒被破坏了！
Book 1 Chapter 9
In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted with what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious to Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest sailor.
Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or rather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.
Herbert shared in some degree the sailor's feelings.
As to the reporter, he simply replied,--
"Upon my word, Pencroft, it's perfectly indifferent to me!"
"But, I repeat, that we haven't any fire!"
"Pooh!"
"Nor any means of relighting it!"
"Nonsense!"
"But I say, Mr. Spilett--"
"Isn't Cyrus here?" replied the reporter.
"Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire for us!"
"With what?"
"With nothing."
What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of his heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus Harding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every science, a possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town in the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him they would never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic eruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the depths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,--
"Cyrus is here!"
While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during his journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of cooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had disappeared. They must consider what was to be done.
First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained almost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be more beneficial to him than any nourishment.
Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the wind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the sea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain places in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had become scarcely habitable. The engineer's condition would, therefore, have been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him with their coats and waistcoats.
Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed, which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea at the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous matter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after having eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which the taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very considerably by the natives. "Never mind!" said the sailor, "the captain will help us soon." Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily they had no means of defending themselves from it.
The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire. Neb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment, therefore, did not succeed.
Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into heat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the boiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to be sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.
After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.
"I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this way, let them say what they will," he exclaimed. "I could sooner light my arms by rubbing them against each other!"
The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle wood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer for the purpose, and besides, there is "the knack," following the usual expression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not "the knack."
Pencroft's ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of wood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them. The hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the efforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed.
"Rub, my boy, rub!" said he.
"I am rubbing," replied Herbert, laughing, "but I don't pretend to do anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be as hot as you are, my good Pencroft!"
This soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this night at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated, for the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled for so small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in one of the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did the same, while Top slept at his master's feet.
Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the morning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on the day before, his first words were:--
"Island or continent?" This was his uppermost thought.
"Well!" replied Pencroft, "we don't know anything about it, captain!"
"You don't know yet?"
"But we shall know," rejoined Pencroft, "when you have guided us into the country."
"I think I am able to try it," replied the engineer, who, without much effort, rose and stood upright.
"That's capital!" cried the sailor.
"I feel dreadfully weak," replied Harding. "Give me something to eat, my friends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven't you?"
This question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds--
"Alas! we have no fire," said Pencroft, "or rather, captain, we have it no longer!"
And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused the engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive attempt to procure fire in the savages' way.
"We shall consider," replied the engineer, "and if we do not find some substance similar to tinder--"
"Well?" asked the sailor.
"Well, we will make matches.
"Chemicals?"
"Chemicals!"
"It is not more difficult than that," cried the reporter, striking the sailor on the shoulder.
The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went out. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea's horizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of the huge precipice.
Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on a block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and sargassum, saying,--
"It is all that we have, Captain Harding."
"Thanks, my boy," replied Harding; "it will do--for this morning at least."
He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.
His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,--
"So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an island, or on a continent?"
"No, captain," replied the boy.
"We shall know to-morrow," said the engineer; "till then, there is nothing to be done."
"Yes," replied Pencroft.
"What?"
"Fire," said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.
"We will make it, Pencroft," replied Harding.
"While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a mountain which commands the country?"
"Yes," replied Spilett, "a mountain which must be rather high--"
"Well," replied the engineer, "we will climb to the summit to-morrow, and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till then, I repeat, there is nothing to be done."
"Yes, fire!" said the obstinate sailor again.
"But he will make us a fire!" replied Gideon Spilett, "only have a little patience, Pencroft!"
The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, "If it depended upon you to do it, we wouldn't taste roast meat very soon"; but he was silent.
Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very little troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained absorbed in thought; then again speaking,--
"My friends," said he, "our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at any rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited place, or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by ourselves."
"Certainly, nothing could be plainer," replied Pencroft.
"But, whether it is an island or a continent," asked Gideon Spilett, "whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?"
"I cannot say exactly," replied the engineer, "but I presume it is some land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was blowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that it could not have varied. If the direction has been maintained from the northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, itself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava, either on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I suppose, to the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct, it will be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall always find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary, this is the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks the country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here as if we are never to go away."
"Never?" cried the reporter. "You say 'Never,' my dear Cyrus?"
"Better to put things at the worst at first," replied the engineer, "and reserve the best for a surprise."
"Well said," remarked Pencroft. "It is to be hoped, too, that this island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships; that would be really unlucky!"
"We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the ascent of the mountain," replied the engineer.
"But to-morrow, captain," asked Herbert, "shall you be in a state to bear the fatigue of the ascent?"
"I hope so," replied the engineer, "provided you and Pencroft, my boy, show yourselves quick and clever hunters."
"Captain," said the sailor, "since you are speaking of game, if on my return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back--"
"Bring it back all the same, Pencroft," replied Harding.
It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the day at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau. Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their store of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or hairy, which might come within their reach.
They set out accordingly about ten o'clock in the morning, Herbert confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,--
"If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that the thunder itself came to light it." All three climbed the bank; and arrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to his two companions,--
"Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?"
"Hunters," replied Herbert. "There is Top already in quest."
"We will hunt, then," said the sailor, "and afterwards we can come back and collect our wood."
This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three sticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding about among the long grass.
This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river, plunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the same trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In certain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development, that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had supposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then, the glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost impenetrable.
It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees, without any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off branches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong not to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first excursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself. Top, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be approached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that the sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest, in which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.
"Well, Pencroft," said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, "if this is all the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won't need a large fire to roast it!"
"Have patience," replied the sailor, "it isn't the game which will be wanting on our return."
"Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?"
"Yes."
"But you don't believe that he will make fire?"
"I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace."
"It will blaze, since my master has said so."
"We shall see!"
Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was edible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond, very much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These almonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them to his companions, who feasted on them.
"Come," said Pencroft, "sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat, and almonds for dessert, that's certainly a good dinner for those who have not a single match in their pocket!"
We mustn't complain," said Herbert.
"I am not complaining, my boy," replied Pencroft, "only I repeat, that meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal."
"Top has found something!" cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top's barking were mingled curious gruntings.
The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how they were to get hold of it.
The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes, then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane. Herbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of the largest members of the rodent order.
Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men for the first time.
However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top's teeth, by which it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.
"The rascal!" cried Pencroft.
All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded by venerable pines.
Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not appear.
"Let us wait," said the boy, "for he will soon come to the surface to breathe."
"Won't he drown?" asked Neb.
"No," replied Herbert, "since he has webbed feet, and is almost an amphibious animal. But watch him."
Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.
Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the surface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from plunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was killed by a blow from Neb's stick.
"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.
"Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!"
Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the height of the sun that it was about two o'clock, he gave the signal to return.
Top's instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half an hour later they arrived at the river.
Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if there was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the current, they returned towards the Chimneys.
But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--
"Herbert! Neb! Look!" he shouted.
Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.
吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特和纳布都知道了发生的事情。这件可能引起严重后果的意外（至少潘克洛夫这样认为）在忠实的水手的伙伴们身上产生了不同的反应。
纳布找到了主人满心高兴，根本不听、或者不愿意听潘克洛夫在说些什么。
赫伯特多少和水手有些同感。
通讯记者听了潘克洛夫的话以后，只是简单地说：
“真的，潘克洛夫，我一点儿也不在乎！”
“可是我还要重复一遍，我们没有火了！”
“呸！”
“也没有办法再生火了！”
“没关系！”
“可是我说，史佩莱先生……”
“赛勒斯不是在这儿吗，”通讯记者答道。“我们的工程师不是活着吗？他会想法子给我们取火的！”
“用什么？”
“什么也不用。”
潘克洛夫还有什么好说的？他没有什么话可说了，因为实际上他也和他的伙伴们一样信服赛勒斯•史密斯。在大家的心目中，工程师就是一个小天地，他是一切科学和全部人类智慧的综合。和赛勒斯在一起，就跟在美国工业最发达的城市里一样。有了他就什么也不缺了；和他在一起不会感到失望。假如有人告诉他们，这块陆地将要被火山吞没，将要下沉到太平洋的深处，他们就会镇静地回答：
“有赛勒斯在这里！瞧赛勒斯的吧！”
工程师躺在担架上，由于一路的颠簸，又昏睡过去，因此他们没法请教他。晚餐只好将就一些。松鸡肉已经吃光了，现在又没有办法烹调其他的野味。况且留下来的锦鸡也不见了。他们只好考虑下一步应该怎么办。
他们首先把赛勒斯•史密斯抬到中堂里去。在那里给他用海藻铺成了一个床铺，海藻还很干。工程师睡得很舒服，这可以使他很快恢复疲劳，无疑比吃任何营养品都更有好处。
黑夜来临了，气候随着风向转为东北风而变得十分寒冷。潘克洛夫在通道里分成的隔间都被海水冲毁了，寒风直灌进来，“石窟”里几乎冷得不能住人。幸亏大家把自己的外套和坎肩小心地盖在工程师身上，要不然工程师的处境就更加困难了。
赫伯特和纳布从海滩上捡了一大堆茨蟹回来，晚上只好拿它们当饭。除了这些软体动物以外，少年从高处岩石上搜集到一些可以吃的海藻，只有在潮水很高的时候，海水才冲得到这些高岩石壁的旁边。这是马尾藻属的植物，是一种昆布，晒干以后产生一种胶状物质，营养相当丰富。通讯记者和他的伙伴们吃了不少茨蟹，又吸了一些昆布的汁，味道还不坏。亚洲沿海地带有些地方的居民常常吃它。“不要紧！”水手说，“赛勒斯先生很快就可以帮助我们了。”天气冷得更加刺骨，他们不幸又没有御寒的办法。
水手心里非常焦急，千方百计地想要取火。纳布也帮助他试验。他找到一些干燥的地苔，用两块鹅卵石砸出火星来，但是地苔不容易起火，点不着，其实这种火星只不过是达到白热时发出来的一点光，完全不象用同样方法从火石里迸出来的火星那样稳定。因此试验的结果没有成功。
潘克洛夫虽然一点也没有把握，可还是接着干，他模仿着土人的方法，用两块干柴摩擦起来。他和纳布进行了一番剧烈的运动，如果根据新的理论把这种运动转化为热的话，那么肯定地说，连轮船的锅炉也可以烧开了！但还是没有结果。小木块固然磨热了，可是比起这两位劳动者身上的热来，还差得很远。
干了一个小时以后，潘克洛夫浑身大汗，赌气把木块摔在地上。
“不管他们怎么说，我也不相信土人是用这个方法取得火的，”他大声说。“再摩下去我的胳膊倒先要烧着了！”
水手否定摩擦取火的办法是没有根据的。土人经常用剧烈摩擦的方法使木柴着火。但并不是每一种木柴都能起火。此外，除了一般的方法以外，还有个“秘诀”，潘克洛夫摩不出火大概就是由于不懂这个“秘诀”的缘故。
潘克洛夫发了一顿脾气，一会儿就好了。赫伯特捡起他扔下的小木块，用力摩起来。这位健壮的水手看见少年还抱着成功的希望在干他已经失败的事，不禁哈哈大笑起来。
“摩吧，孩子，摩吧！”他说。
“我是在摩，”赫伯特笑道，“可是我也就是想使身体暖和一些，免得冻得直抖，并没有说要摩出火来；马上我就要和你一样热了，我的好潘克洛夫！”
不久，少年果然累得满头大汗。他们只好放弃这项工作，至少是当天晚上不再作取火的尝试。吉丁•史佩莱重复了足有二十次，说不能为了这一点小小的困难去打扰赛勒斯•史密斯。说完之后，他就躺到一个隔间里的沙铺上去了。赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫也同样躺了下来，托普睡在它主人的脚边。
第二天是3月28日，早上八点钟，工程师醒来了，他看见伙伴们都围在旁边看着自己，他还是象前一天那样，开口就问：
“荒岛还是大陆？”
他最惦记的就是这个问题。
“我们还一点也不知道哩，史密斯先生！”潘克洛夫答道。
“你们还不知道？”
“等你带我们到内陆去察看过以后，”潘克洛夫补充说，“我们就知道了。”
“我想我是能够试一试的，”工程师说，他不费多大的气力，就站了起来。
“太好了！”水手大声说。
“我感到浑身软得厉害，”史密斯说。“给我一点吃的，朋友们，不久就会好的。你们不是有火吗？”
他们没有马上就回答。隔了几秒钟，潘克洛夫说：
“唉！我们没有火，说得更正确些，我们现在没有火！”
于是水手把前一天的事从头到尾说了一遍。他把那根独一无二的火柴的趣事也告诉工程师了，然后又谈到他打算用土人的方法取火而没有成功的经过。
“我们可以想办法，”工程师说，“假如找不到跟火绒差不多的东西……”
“那怎么办呢？”水手问道。
“那么，我们就自己做火柴。”
“化学火柴吗？”
“化学火柴！”
“这并不比昨天你那样更困难，”通讯记者拍了一下水手的肩膀，大声说。
水手觉得事情没有那么简单，可是他也不反驳。大家都出去了，天气变得非常晴朗。太阳正从水平线上升起来，高大的悬崖上一层层的岩石被照得一片金黄，十分美丽。
工程师匆匆向周围看了一眼，就在一块石头上坐了下来。赫伯特递了一些蛤蜊和马尾藻给他说：
“我们只剩下这些了，史密斯先生。”
“谢谢你，孩子，”史密斯说，“够了……至少今天早上够吃了。”
他津津有味地吃着这粗糙的食品，喝了几口淡水，这是用一个巨大的贝壳从河里舀来的。
伙伴们默默地看着他。赛勒斯•史密斯总算吃饱了，就叉着两臂说：
“那么，朋友，你们还不知道命运把我们扔在荒岛上还是大陆上，是吗？”
“是的，史密斯先生。”少年说。
“明天我们就知道了，”工程师说，“到那时候就没有别的事了。”
“有的。”潘克洛夫说。
“什么？”
“生火。”水手说，这个念头牢牢地占据了他的脑海。
“我们一定要生火的，潘克洛夫。”史密斯说。
“你们昨天抬着我的时候，我似乎看见西面有一座高山俯瞰着这片土地，是吗？”
“是的，”史佩莱答道，“那座山一定相当高……”
“好吧，”工程师说，“明天我们就爬到山顶上去，那时候就可以知道这片土地是荒岛还是大陆了。我再说一遍，到那时候就没有别的事了。”
“有的，生火！”顽固的水手又说了一遍。
“他会给我们生火的！”吉丁•史佩莱说，“要耐心一些，潘克洛夫！”
水手瞪了史佩莱一眼，好象在说，“假如靠你的话，我们暂时就不要想吃烤肉了。”可是他没有说出口。
这时候史密斯并没有答话。他好象一点也不为火的问题而操心。他沉思了几分钟，然后说：
“朋友们，总的说来，我们的处境也许相当悲惨，可是也很明显，我们不是在大陆上，就是在荒岛上。假如是在大陆上，那是可以到达有人居住的地方的，只是费力多少的问题。要是在荒岛上呢，如果岛上有人，我们可以由居民帮助，想法子脱离这个窘境；如果岛上没有人，那就只好自己想法子了。”
“一点也不错，没有比这个更明显的了。”潘克洛夫说。
“可是，不管是荒岛还是大陆，”吉丁•史佩莱问道，“你认为我们被风暴扔在什么地方了呢，赛勒斯？”
“这我不能肯定，”工程师回答说，“可是我猜是太平洋里的陆地。当我们离开里士满的时候，刮的是东北风，风力很大，足可以证明方向一直没有改变。如果风向始终保持从东北到西南，那么我们就越过了北卡罗来纳州、南卡罗来纳州、乔治亚州、墨西哥湾、墨西哥本土的狭窄地带，然后是太平洋的一部分。我估计气球至少飞出六七千英里了。即使风向改变了半个方角，我们也一定被带到曼达瓦群岛，或是帕摩图群岛；可是如果风力比我想象中的还要大，那么甚至可能来到了新西兰。要是真的到了新西兰，我们就很容易回故土了。不管是英国人或是毛利人，我们总可以找到几个可以打交道的。反过来说，假如这里不过是一个小群岛中的荒岛海岸，——这一点我们可以从那座能俯瞰周围的高山顶上看出来——那时候，我们就只能在这里做长期打算，考虑怎样舒舒服服地住下来了。”
“‘长期’？”通讯记者喊道。“你说‘长期’，亲爱的赛勒斯？”
“开始的时候最好把事情往最坏处想，”工程师说，“如果将来有一个好结果，就把它当做意外的收获。”
“对，”潘克洛夫说。“不过，如果这真是一个孤岛的话，我还希望它不在船只的航线以外；要是那样就真倒楣了！”
“在没有上山以前，我们还不能肯定应该指望什么。”工程师说。
“可是，赛勒斯先生，”赫伯特问道，“明天上山，你经得起劳累吗？”
“我希望能做到，”工程师回答说，“这要看你和潘克洛夫是不是个又灵活又能干的猎手了，孩子。”
“史密斯先生，”水手说，“既然你谈到野味，那么我可以向你保证，只要能烤，我就一定能把野味带回来……”
“不管怎么样，你把野味带回来吧，潘克洛夫。”史密斯说。
大家商量的结果是这样：这一天工程师和通讯记者留在“石窟”里，顺便视察一下海岸和上面的高地，纳布、赫伯特和水手还是到森林里去，一方面搜集柴火，另一方面只要遇到动物，不管是飞禽还是走兽，到手就抓。
大约上午十点钟的时候，他们出发了。赫伯特满怀信心，纳布兴致勃勃，只有潘克洛夫一个人在旁边嘀嘀咕咕：
“假如回来以后家里有了火，那准是电火点着的。”
三个人一起爬上了河岸。走到河流拐角的地方时，水手站住了脚，对他的两个伙伴说：
“我们先打猎，还是先砍柴？”
“先打猎，”赫伯特答道。“你看，托普已经在搜找野味了。”
“那么就打猎吧，”水手说，“等回来再捡木柴。”
大家同意之后，赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫就从一棵小枞树上各扳了一根粗枝，跟上托普，这时候它正在深草丛中乱跑乱跳。
这一次猎人们没有循着河道前进，而是直接深入丛林。这里的树木也是一样，大多属于松柏科，某些地方的松树比较稀疏，一丛一丛地生在一起，非常高大，根据它们的生长情况看来，似乎当地的纬度比工程师想象中的要高一些。林间的空地上有许多树桩，都因为年深月久渐渐磨秃了。这里遍地都是干柴，燃料简直烧用不完。过了空地以后，矮树林逐渐又密起来，想穿过去几乎都很困难。
这些树丛中没有一条现成的道路，要想找路走的确很不容易。因此水手走几步就折断一根树枝，以便回来的时候辨认。第一次他是和赫伯特循着河道走的，今天没有照上次那样走也许是失策了，因为走了一个钟头，什么动物也没有看见。只有一些小鸟，他们还没走近，鸟就被在树枝下乱窜的托普惊起来了。连锦鸡也没有看见，看样子水手只好回到森林的沼泽地带去，也就是上次他偶然钓到松鸡的地方。
“潘克洛夫，”纳布略带讥讽地说，“假如你答应带给主人的野味就是这些，那倒不需要什么火来烤它们！”
“耐心点儿，”水手说，“恐怕回去以后没有的倒不是野味。”
“你难道还不相信史密斯先生吗？”
“是的。”
“你认为他不会生起火来吗？”
“要等到亲眼看见木柴在炉子里烧我才相信呢。”
“既然主人那么说过，一定会有火的。”
“等着瞧吧！”
这时候太阳还没有升到天空。于是他们继续进行探索，赫伯特发现一棵树上的果子可以吃，这样探索多少是有一些成绩了。这是一棵南欧松，松子非常好吃，是欧美温带地区的珍品。这棵树上的松子已经熟透了，大家一面吃，一面听赫伯特介绍。
“好吧，”潘克洛夫说，“拿海藻当面包，生蛤蜊当肉，松子当饭后的点心，对我们这些口袋里连一根火柴也没有的人说来，这一餐就算不错了！”
“我们不应该埋怨。”赫伯特说。
“我并没有埋怨谁呀，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“我只是再说一遍，这顿饭，肉太少了。”
“托普找到什么东西了！”纳布一面喊，一面向一丛树木中奔去，托普已经钻到里面看不见的地方了，但还在叫。和托普的叫声夹杂在一起的还有一种奇怪的声音，好象是什么东西在哼。
水手和赫伯特紧跟着纳布跑去。很明显，假如那里有什么野味，现在首先应该考虑的是怎样把它捉住，而不应该讨论怎样烹调。
猎人才进入灌木丛，就看见托普咬着一只野兽的耳朵在和它搏斗。这只四足兽很象猪，差不多有两英尺半长，身体是深褐色的，肚子上的颜色比较浅，浑身的毛又稀又硬。这时候它的足趾紧紧地按在地上，趾间好象有脚蹼连着。赫伯特认得它是水豚，这是啮齿动物中最大的一目。
这时候水豚并没有和狗搏斗。它的眼睑很厚，眼珠陷在里面笨拙地转动着。也许它还是第一次看见人类。
纳布握紧了棍子正打算过去把它打倒，这时候它却挣脱了托普的利齿（因为托普只是咬住了它的耳朵边）低低地叫了一声，向赫伯特冲去，几乎把他撞倒，然后就跑进丛林不见了。
“该死的东西！”潘克洛夫喊道。
三个人马上跟着托普一起追上去，可是他们才赶上托普，水豚就跳到一个古松覆盖下的水池子里去不见了。
纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫呆呆地站住了。托普纵身跳进水池，可是水豚躲在水底没有出来。
“我们等一会吧，”少年说，“它很快就要到水面来呼吸的。”
“它不会淹死吗？”纳布问道。
“不会，”赫伯特回答说，“它长着蹼足，几乎可以算是一种两栖动物。注意看着它。”
托普还是呆在水里。潘克洛夫和他的两个伙伴站在池边三面把守着，切断水豚的退路。托普在水面上寻找水豚。
赫伯特的话果然不错。几分钟以后它就露出水面来了。托普一下子跳在它的身上，拖住它不让它沉下去。过了一会儿，水豚被拖到岸边来，纳布一棍子便把它打死了。
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫叫着，他总是第一个发出胜利呼声。
“只要给我生上火，就可以把这只猪吃得只剩骨头了！”
潘克洛夫把水豚扛在肩上，他看了看太阳，估计已经有两点钟，就挥手喊大家回去了。
托普的直觉给猎人带来很大的好处，多亏这只聪明的畜生，他们才找到回去的旧路。只费了半个钟头的工夫，他们就到达了河边。
潘克洛夫还象以前那样很快地做了一个木筏，当然，假如没有火，这一切劳动就都白费了。木筏顺流而下，一直向“石窟”漂去。
还没有走到五十步，水手就站住了，他指着悬崖的转角，扯开嗓门欢呼了一声。
“赫伯特！纳布！瞧！”他喊道。
只见岩石丛中，有一缕轻烟袅袅上升。
Book 1 Chapter 10
In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The captain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the other, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.
"Well, yes, my brave fellow," cried the reporter.
"Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we will have a feast presently!"
"But who lighted it?" asked Pencroft.
"The sun!"
Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which had furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could scarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of questioning the engineer.
"Had you a burning-glass, sir?" asked Herbert of Harding.
"No, my boy," replied he, "but I made one."
And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter's watches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass, which, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused it to blaze.
The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer without saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if Cyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At last speech returned to him, and he cried,--
"Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!"
"It is noted," replied the reporter.
Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara, properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear, crackling fire.
The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re-established.
It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their day well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye, accustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time on the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The mountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of an observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least fifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the question of "island or continent," to which he attached so much importance.
They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent. The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast, during which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects for the next day.
Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best to do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only shook his head without uttering a word.
"To-morrow," he repeated, "we shall know what we have to depend upon, and we will act accordingly."
The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and the inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon buried in a deep sleep.
No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th of March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion which must determine their fate.
All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough to sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.
Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft burned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be wanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in the morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys. Following Pencroft's advice, it appeared best to take the road already traversed through the forest, and to return by another route. It was also the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south angle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at the point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path, already trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o'clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border of the forest. The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at first, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from the shore towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals were seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence hunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who would allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even have been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in its configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being to climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he went. At ten o'clock a halt of a few minutes was made. On leaving the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the explorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by buttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense claw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys, bristling with trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone. There appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no doubt, were watercourses.
On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman would have said, "His bonnet was a thocht ajee." It appeared formed of bare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.
They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.
"We are on volcanic ground," Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which, by a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first plateau.
The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met with. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet lower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost impenetrable to the sun's rays.
During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints which indicated the recent passage of large animals.
"Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly," said Pencroft.
"Well," replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in India, and the lion in Africa, "we shall soon learn how successfully to encounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!"
They ascended but slowly.
The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell, and they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to go round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable path, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At twelve o'clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau, which most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this point the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful support of the central cone.
At one o'clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade of the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted behind the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl, the female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his red plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.
After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on each other's shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil appeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being exceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between them. The animals which frequented these heights--and there were numerous traces of them-- must necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine, chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this was not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden--"Sheep!" he shouted.
All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size, with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.
They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the name of the musmon.
"Have they legs and chops?" asked the sailor.
"Yes," replied Herbert.
"Well, then, they are sheep!" said Pencroft.
The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.
"Good-bye, till we meet again," cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb could not help laughing.
The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In some places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such as whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.
In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four o'clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only remained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have had a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the open sea. Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of three thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings. The purity of the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect calm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the vast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the west, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor--mist rather than clouds--began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors under the influence of the solar rays.
Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid under their feet.
The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening came on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his companions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at the plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an encampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping afterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks, among which it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant. However, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood, which covered certain parts of the plateau. While the sailor was preparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon returned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb's breath, a crackling fire showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold temperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird, which Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the capybara and some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It was not half-past six when all was finished.
Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before taking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the base of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit being inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible that from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north, the plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain could not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not get round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the western part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would in part be altogether unattained.
The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and Neb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the day, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north. Herbert accompanied him.
The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus Harding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In some places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without hindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path, in which two persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point the slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the two parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy degrees, the path became impracticable.
But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for ascending the cone.
In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth of the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at the periods when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.
Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed by the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing obscurity.
There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be seen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until he was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the volcano and favored their ascent.
As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely extinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in the dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued from this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the earth. The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous vapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete extinction. Cyrus Harding's attempt would succeed.
Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior, saw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously. At each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered the field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the southern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid Antares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is believed to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the crater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle, and lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross, which replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.
It was nearly eight o'clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.
It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a radius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it connected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not yet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular line.
But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.
It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached from the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for an instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad's hand, and in a grave voice,--
"An island!" said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared beneath the waves.
几分钟以后，三个猎人就来到噼啪作响的篝火前了。史密斯和通讯记者就在旁边。潘克洛夫手里提着水豚，一言不发地看看这个，又看看那个。
“怎么样，我的勇士。”通讯记者招呼着他。
“火，真是火，可以把这只大肥猪烤得烂熟，我们马上就可以大吃一顿了！”
“可是谁生的火呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“太阳！”
吉丁•史佩莱回答得很对。使潘克洛夫感到奇怪的这股热竟是太阳产生的。水手简直不能相信自己的眼睛，他惊讶得楞住了，甚至都没有想到问工程师一声。
“你大概带着放大镜吧？”赫伯特向史密斯问道。
“没有，孩子，”他答道，“可是我做了一个。”
于是他把充作放大镜用的工具拿出来给大家看。它的构造很简单，工程师和通讯记者各有一只表，这就是用表上的玻璃做成的。工程师用一点土把两片玻璃的边缘粘上，中间灌了水，就做成一个正式的放大镜了。它把太阳光聚在干燥的地苔上，不久地苔就燃烧起来。
水手细看了这个工具以后，一句话也不说，呆呆地瞧着工程师。从他这个神情可以看出，在他的心目中，赛勒斯•史密斯即使不是一个神仙，也一定是一个不平凡的人。终于他又说话了，他大声喊道：
“记下来，史佩莱先生，记在你的本子上！”
“已经记下来了。”通讯记者答道。
接着纳布协同水手准备了肉叉，洗净了水豚，很快就在旺盛的、噼啪作响的篝火上，象烤小猪似的把它烤起来了。
“石窟”里又变得舒适起来，不仅是因为有了温暖的炉火，而且还用木柴和泥土重新建起了隔板。
显然，工程师和他的伙伴们这一天工作的成绩很不坏。赛勒斯•史密斯的体力几乎已经完全恢复了，从他能够爬上高地这一点就足可以证明。他对目测高度和距离很擅长，他站在高地的顶上，长时间地注视着火山锥，明天他就打算爬到锥顶上去了。这座山在西北大约离这里六英里的地方，他估计有三千五百英尺高。如果站在山顶上，至少可以看出五十英里去。因此史密斯非常关心的“荒岛还是大陆”的问题，就可以很容易地解决了。
他们的晚餐非常丰盛。大家对水豚肉都赞不绝口。再加上马尾藻和南欧松的松子，这顿饭就算很齐全了。吃饭的时候，工程师很少说话。他在盘算着第二天的计划。
潘克洛夫有一两次提出来最好这么办，最好那么办；可是赛勒斯•史密斯考虑问题很有条理，他只是摇摇头不作声。
“明天，”他重复道，“我们就可以知道应该指望什么，然后我们就要采取必要的行动了。”
吃完饭以后，他们在篝火堆上又加了几把木柴，然后“石窟”里的全体居民——包括忠实的托普在内——很快就深入梦乡了。这一晚安然度过，没有发生任何事情。第二天是3月29日，他们精神抖擞地爬起身来，准备参加决定他们命运的一次远征。
一切都已准备停当，只等出发了。剩下的水豚肉至少还够大家吃一昼夜。此外他们估计还能在路上找到更多的食物。作放大镜用的玻璃又安到工程师和通讯记者的表上去了。潘克洛夫烧了一些焦布代替火绒。在火成岩的地区，火石是不会缺少的。早上七点半，每人都带着木棍，从“石窟”出发了。潘克洛夫提议最好走森林里已经开辟过的小道，回来的时候再找别的路；大家同意这个意见。这也是到高山去最直的道路。他们绕过南面的拐角，沿着河的左岸走去，走到河流折向西南的时候，他们就离开河道了。他们在常绿树下找到已经走过的旧路，九点钟的时候，赛勒斯和他的伙伴们到达了森林的西部边缘。刚刚走过的一带，最初地面尽是沼泽；后来是一片干燥的沙地，但是始终很少起伏，直到这里才逐渐形成斜坡，从岸边一直往内陆高上去。在这一带林木中可以看见一些胆小的动物。托普立刻向它们扑去，可是它的主人认为现在还没有到时候，打猎要等到以后再说，因此马上就把它喊回来了。工程师只要确定了一个主张，他就下了决心，从不轻易改变。对于周围的地势以及一切自然物产，他甚至连看也不看，他的伟大目标就是爬上前面的高山，因此他就一直朝着高山前进。十点钟的时候，他们休息了几分钟。走出森林以后，山区的形势就呈现在这群探险家的眼前了。这座山有两个火山锥；其中的一个高约两千五百英尺，锥顶好象被削平了一般，下面有许多拱柱似的乱石支持着，好象一只大爪子站在地上，足趾向四面撑开，趾间形成很多峡谷，谷里树木丛生，最后的一丛树木直齐较低的锥顶。面向东北的山坡上树木较少，可以看见上面有一条条很深的罅隙，那里一定是水道。
第二个火山锥在第一个的上边，略呈圆形，稍稍偏向一边，好象一顶歪戴在耳朵上的大圆帽子。这个火山锥看来全是由泥土构成的，表面上突出一块块的红石头。
他们打算爬上第二个火山锥，按地势看来，最好是沿着支脉的山脊上去。
“我们来到火山地带了。”赛勒斯•史密斯说完后，就带着他的伙伴们一步一步地从一个支脉往上爬，这个支脉弯弯曲曲地通向第一个高地，因此走起来比较容易。
这里显然曾经发生过地震，到处都是乱石、大量的玄武岩和浮石的碎片。枞树三三两两地生长着，它们的枝叶极密，把几百尺以下的峡谷深处遮盖得几乎连一线阳光也透不过去。
在爬山的第一阶段，赫伯特认出一些庞大的动物新近留下来的足迹。
“这些野兽也许不会轻易放我们过去的。”潘克洛夫说。
“看吧，”通讯记者曾在印度打过虎，非洲猎过狮，他说，“我们会想办法的。不过目前我们应该特别小心！”
他们慢慢地往山上爬去。
由于道路曲折，还有许多障碍，他们不能直接往上爬，距离就变得很远了。有时候地面突然一落千丈，他们发现自己面临着一个深渊，只好绕道过去。他们把大量的时间和许多气力都浪费在回头找可以通行的道路上。十二点钟的时候，探险小队在一大丛枞树底下停下来吃饭，附近有一条山涧，流水在下冲成一个瀑布。在这里他们发现到第一个高地才走了一半路。大概在天黑以前是不能到达高地了。这里所能看到的海洋要宽阔得多，可是右边却有一个隆起的海角挡住了他们的视线，看不见那边有没有陆地。左边可以一直往北看到几英里以外。可是往西北部他们所住的那一带地方看去，视线就突然被一道奇形怪状的山脊遮住了，这道山脊构成了中央火山锥的有力支柱。所以史密斯的问题大家还是一点也推断不出来。
一点钟了，他们继续上山。他斜着向西南方往上爬，又走进了一个浓密的灌木丛。有几对雉科的鹑鸡类飞禽在树荫下拍着翅膀。这些飞禽是角雉，它们的喉咙下面挂着肉瓣，眼睛后面生着一对圆形的小冠毛。这种鸟的大小和鸡差不多，雌的是浑身褐色，雄的羽毛通红，点缀着白色的斑点，非常美丽。吉丁•史佩莱飞起一块石头，抛得巧妙而有力，一下子就打死了一只角雉，潘克洛夫呼吸了一阵新鲜空气，肚子已经饿了，因此两眼始终贪馋地盯着它们。
他们离开灌木地带以后，就互相蹬着肩膀，协助着翻过一段一百英尺左右的陡坡，爬上一个平台。这里很少树木，土壤好象是火山土。从这里再往上爬就必须弯弯曲曲地绕道而行了，因为坡度很陡，每跨一步都有粉身碎骨的危险，必须十分小心。纳布和赫伯特在前，潘克洛夫在后，工程师和通讯记者在中间。这里有很多兽迹。能够常到这一带高岗上来的动物一定是站得稳而且脊骨柔软的羚羊或山羊。他们看见几只，然而潘克洛夫认错了，他突然喊道：
“绵羊！”
大家都停了下来，离他们大约五十英尺的地方，有六只相当大的动物，它们的角向后弯曲，顶端扁平，显得非常有力，褐色光滑的长毛下隐藏着蓬松的底绒。
赫伯特告诉大家说，这不是普通的绵羊，而是一般温带山区常见的摩弗仑羊。
“它们有羊腿和羊排吗？”水手问道。
“有的。”赫伯特说。
“好吧，那么它们就是绵羊！”潘克洛夫说。
这些动物一动也不动地站在大块的玄武石中间，呆呆地看着人们，好象还是第一次看见人类。然后，它们不知怎么突然一惊，跳过山石就逃，转眼就不见了。
“再会吧，我们改日再见！”潘克洛夫望着它们滑稽地喊道。赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特和纳布都不禁大笑起来。
他们继续登山。这里到处是遗留下来的熔岩。有时候含硫的泉水挡住他们的道路，他们只好从旁边绕过去。有些地方，硫在其他物质中形成结晶，例如在由无数的小长石晶体构成的白色火山岩滓里。
较低的火山锥顶部被削平成一块高地，临近第一高地的时候，登山十分困难。快到四点钟了，他们走完了最后的一带林区。现在周围只是偶然有些地方生长着几棵弯曲的矮松，它们在这么高的地方，显然是经常要和海上吹来的狂风顽抗的。这一天万里无云，大气宁静，这实在是工程师和他的伙伴们的幸运，因为在海拔三千英尺的地方，即使是一阵微风，也会对他们的攀登不利。他们只感到天气清朗。周围一点声音也没有。他们看不见太阳，因为那个高火山锥遮住西方的半边水平线，把太阳挡住了。随着红日的西坠，海滩上庞大的山影也愈来愈长了。东方出现了水汽——与其说是云，还不如说是雾——在日光照耀下，显得五光十色。
这群探险家离高地只有五百英尺了，他们打算到那里再扎营过夜。然而由于山势曲折，实际上他们还要走两英里以上，脚下的泥土好象在往下滑。这里山坡一般都很陡，只要碰到经不起踩的风化了的石头，他们就要往下滚。夜幕低垂下来，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们费尽了气力，爬了七个钟头，直到几乎完全黑了的时候，才达到第一个火山锥顶的高地上。现在首先必须安排露宿，必须填饱肚子，然后睡觉，这样才能恢复体力。第二个火山锥的底部是许多岩石，在这些石堆中间，很容易找到一个安身的地方。附近的燃料不多，然而高地上多少还有几处生长着一些灌木，他们可以捡些干柴和地苔生火。水手想法子利用石头围成一个火炉，这时候纳布和赫伯特去捡柴了。他们很快就捡了许多回来。他们把火石打出火星来，点着焦布，纳布吹了几口气，几分钟以后，在岩石的避风处，一团烈火就噼噼啪啪地燃烧起来。他们生火的目的只是为了夜间御寒，而不是为了烤鸟肉，纳布把打来的鸟留下来预备第二天吃。他们的晚餐是：剩下的水豚肉和几打南欧松松子。他们一直吃到晚上六点半才全部吃完。
然后，赛勒斯•史密斯打算乘天没有黑透以前，探索一下较高火山锥的环状底层。他打算在休息以前了解一下，如果火山锥的周围陡得没法上去，是不是还能在它的底下绕过去。这个问题使他想得出神，因为根据“帽子”向北倾斜的方向，高地是可能走不通的。如果没法从这边爬上山顶去，又不能从火山锥底下绕到那边去，那么就没法视察西方的陆地了，也就是说，他们登山的目的就要成为泡影了。
于是工程师就不顾疲乏，沿着高地的边缘往北走，留下潘克洛夫和纳布准备睡铺，吉丁•史佩莱记录当天发生的事情。只有赫伯特陪着他一块去。
夜色优美而宁静，周围的光线还不太暗。赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特挨在一起走着，路上一句话也不说。高地上有些地方形势开阔，他们顺利地走了过去；有的地方有许多岩石拦住去路，只剩下一条窄道，两个人并排就走不过去了。步行了二十分钟以后，赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特不得不停下来。两个火山锥的斜坡到这里合并成一个了。这里没有山肩把山的两部分隔开。坡度将近七十度，不能通行了。
工程师和少年不得不放弃从下面绕过去的念头，可是这么一来，他们反而得到一个爬上火山锥顶去的机会。
他们的面前有一个深洞。那就是棱角粗糙的火山口，火山爆发时，岩浆就从这里喷出来，凝固的熔岩和硬结的火山渣形成一层层宽阔的天然梯阶，这样他们要爬到山顶上去就非常方便了。
史密斯匆匆地看了一眼，就带领着少年，毫不犹豫地向巨大的山洞里走去，愈往里面走，光线就愈暗。
离山顶还有一千英尺。火山口里的斜坡能不能走呢？这个问题马上就可以知道了。意志坚决的工程师决心走到不能往上再走为止。幸而火山内部的斜坡一直蜿蜒而上，于是他们顺顺当当地攀登上去。
火山肯定是完全熄灭了。山坡上没有一缕烟，黑洞里也看不见一点火星，既没有轰隆声，也没有低微的响动，这个黑黝黝的深井也许一直通到地壳的底层，然而里面甚至一点颤动也没有。火山口里的空气丝毫没有硫磺的蒸汽味，说明它还不只是一座睡火山，而且是完全熄灭了的死火山。赛勒斯•史密斯的探索可以成功了。
他和赫伯特一步一步爬上内壁，只见头顶上的火山口愈来愈大了。通过火山口所看到的圆形天空的半径明显地扩大起来。这两位探险家每走一步，就有更多的星星映入他们的眼帘。满天美丽的星座灿烂地照耀着。天蝎座的主星在头上闪闪发光，不远的地方是人马座的马腹一，据说这颗星距离地球最近。然后，随着火山口的扩大，又出现了南鱼座的北落师门和南三角座。最后几乎在接近南极的地方，南十字座在天空闪耀着；它的位置相当于北半球的北极星。
赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特到达火山锥顶最高峰的时候，已经将近晚上八点钟了。
这时候周围一片漆黑，他们连两英里以外的地方也看不见。是大海包围着这块陆地呢，还是西边和太平洋中的什么大陆相连接呢？现在还没法知道。西方的水平线上很清楚地呈现出一条带状的乌云，它使夜色更加昏暗。周围只有一个大圆圈，分不清哪里是陆地，哪里是海洋。
可是水平线上突然有一处透出一丝微弱的光芒，乌云渐渐地往头顶移动，光线也随着慢慢地照到地面上来。
原来是一钩新月正在西沉，乌云移开以后，月光足可以清清楚楚地照亮水平线。一瞬间，工程师看见新月倒映在水波上，荡漾不止。赛勒斯•史密斯一把抓住少年的手，沉重地说：
“是一个荒岛！”这时候，这一钩新月落到水波下去了。
Book 1 Chapter 11
Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the encampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they would consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep, and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders enjoyed profound repose.
The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed him in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the productions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.
It was about seven o'clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one appeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions; the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them. Pencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would not have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on the rock.
"Pshaw," said he, "we left Richmond without permission from the authorities! It will be hard if we don't manage to get away some day or other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!"
Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of the enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.
The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening, to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which furrowed the northern part of the island.
The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent. Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way to it.
As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to the complete extinction of the volcano.
Before eight o'clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern edge.
"The sea, the sea everywhere!" they cried, as if their lips could not restrain the words which made islanders of them.
The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore, which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before. But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a sail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the island occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be infinite.
The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme limits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his eyebrows.
From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these terms:
"About what size is this island?"
Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.
Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he was placed; then,--
"My friends," said he, "I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles."
"And consequently an area?"
"That is difficult to estimate," replied the engineer, "for it is so uneven."
If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer's advice, had drawn the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.
This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter.
The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high point from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.
From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.
From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.
This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island, already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.
At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles.
As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his companions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about three hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.
"Is it a freshwater lake?" asked Pencroft.
"Certainly," replied the engineer, "for it must be fed by the water which flows from the mountain."
"I see a little river which runs into it," said Herbert, pointing out a narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.
"Yes," said Harding; "and since this stream feeds the lake, most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return."
This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest, other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such was the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition to the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.
The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary, in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two zones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part of the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the contrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the sandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf.
Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the sand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing remained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.
One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have a great effect upon the future of the castaways.
Was the island inhabited?
It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.
Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling in the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points, that is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have been difficult, even to Pencroft's eyes, to discover a habitation there. Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling village. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to be an absolute desert.
Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this question. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large Polynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island, of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes. Would Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude without instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it was best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring natives.
The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems ascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked in a general way on the reporter's plan. They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of view, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.
But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding said to them in a calm, grave voice,--
Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of the Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time, perhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes by chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there is not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared that it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say, too much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from you--"
"And you are right, my dear Cyrus," replied the reporter, with animation. "You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and you can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?"
"I will obey you in everything, captain," said Herbert, seizing the engineer's hand.
"My master always, and everywhere!" cried Neb.
"As for me," said the sailor, "if I ever grumble at work, my name's not Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America of this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in order and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of the Union. Only, I ask one thing."
"What is that?" said the reporter.
"It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists, who have come here to settle." Harding could not help smiling, and the sailor's idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added, that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.
"Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!" cried Pencroft.
"One minute, my friends," said the engineer. "It seems to me it would be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes, promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.
"Very good," said the reporter. "In the future, that will simplify the instructions which we shall have to give and follow."
"Indeed," said the sailor, "already it is something to be able to say where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like somewhere."
"The Chimneys, for example," said Herbert.
"Exactly!" replied Pencroft. "That name was the most convenient, and it came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for our first encampment, captain?"
"Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it."
"Good! as for the others, that will be easy," returned the sailor, who was in high spirits. "Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did, whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point, Cape Disappointment!"
"Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding," said Herbert, "of Mr. Spilett, of Neb!--"
"My name!" cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.
"Why not?" replied Pencroft. "Port Neb, that would do very well! And Cape Gideon--"
"I should prefer borrowing names from our country," said the reporter, "which would remind us of America."
"Yes, for the principal ones," then said Cyrus Harding; "for those of the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing, that of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes, that of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names will recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which will recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better on our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine what it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks which afterwards will he discovered, we can christen them as we find them. What do you think, my friends?"
The engineer's proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to give names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write them down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be definitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain, Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had suggested.
"Now," said the reporter, "to this peninsula at the southwest of the island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a reptile's tail."
"Adopted," said the engineer.
"Now," said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, "let us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark Gulf."
"Capital!" cried Pencroft, "and we can complete the resemblance by naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape."
"But there are two capes," observed the reporter.
"Well," replied Pencroft, "we can have North Mandible Cape and South Mandible Cape."
"They are inscribed," said Spilett.
"There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to be named," said Pencroft.
"That is, the extremity of Union Bay?" asked Herbert.
"Claw Cape," cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some part of his domain.
In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped island represented.
Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect Heights.
Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.
The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh discoveries.
As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the Northern Hemisphere.
Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--
"Well! we are preciously stupid!"
"Why?" asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to depart.
"Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!"
Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer's name and all his companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--
"Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it Lincoln Island!"
The engineer's proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.
And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!
Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.
半个钟头以后，赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特回到了营地。工程师简单地告诉伙伴们说，上天把他们扔在一个荒岛上了，其他情况明天再研究。然后大家就去准备睡觉。这群荒岛上的居民，在海拔二千五百英尺的山洞里安安稳稳地睡了一夜。
第二天，3月30日，匆匆忙忙地吃完了早饭——除了烤角雉以外，别的什么也没有——工程师打算再爬到火山顶上去，仔细观察一下，如果荒岛跟任何陆地都不接近，或是在往来太平洋各群岛的航线以外，那么他们就可能一辈子困守在这里。这一次伙伴们跟着他参加了新的探索。他们也想看一下荒岛，因为今后他们的一切需要都必须依靠岛上的物产来供应。
早上七点钟左右，赛勒斯•史密斯、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、吉丁•史佩莱和纳布离开了营地。他们对于这个处境似乎并不感到焦急。他们对自己有信心。这是毫无疑问的，但是有一点必须指出，就是，史密斯的信心基础和他的伙伴们不一样。史密斯所以满怀着信心，因为他认为能够从这片荒凉的土地上取得他和他的伙伴们需要的一切生活必需品，而伙伴们所以毫不担忧则是因为有赛勒斯•史密斯和他们在一起。特别是潘克洛夫，自从生火的事情以后，他任何时候也不感到悲观，只要有工程师和他在一起，即使在一块光秃秃的石头上，他都不伯。
“呸！”他说，“我们没有经过官方的许可一样能够离开里士满！何况这里肯定没有人会阻拦我们，我们要是再想不出法子逃出去，那才怪呢！”
赛勒斯•史密斯按照昨晚走过的路出发。他们沿着形成山肩的高地，绕过火山锥向巨大的山洞走去。天气非常晴朗。太阳悬挂在万里无云的天空，阳光照遍了整个东面的山坡。
他们走到火山口前。它和工程师在黑暗中所辨认出来的完全一样，也就是说，象一个庞大的漏斗，从上到下，愈来愈宽，从高地到顶端有一千英尺。洞口以下是一道道又宽又厚的熔岩，它们从山坡上蜿蜒到山下，标志着当初岩浆流向低处山谷的道路，荒岛的北部遍地都是这些山谷形成的凹沟。
火山口内部的斜坡不过三十五度到四十度，爬上去既不困难也没有障碍。这里可以看出，很久以前遗留下来的熔岩大概还是在侧面的新喷口没有开出来以前从顶口上漫出来的。
火山管从底层一直通向火山口，它的深度肉眼没法观测，因为光线太暗了。然而火山已经完全熄灭，这是毫无疑问的。
不到八点钟，史密斯和他的伙伴们一起来到了火山口的顶峰，他们站在北边隆起的锥形小丘上。
“海，到处是海！”他们不由自主地这样喊道，这句话使他们一变而为岛上的居民了。
不错，一片辽阔无边的大海环绕着他们！也许赛勒斯•史密斯在没有二次爬上火山锥顶以前，还希望前一天晚上在黑暗中没有看清，希望这次能发现海滨和岛岸。然而远到天边，也就是说在半径五十多英里的圆周内，都没有任何东西。看不见一片陆地，没有一叶孤帆。周围空旷的地方只看见茫茫的海洋——荒岛就是这个辽阔无边的圆形的中心。
工程师和他的伙伴们一动也不动地站在那里，默默地观察了几分钟，大海的每一个方向，直到最远的边缘都看遍了。潘克洛夫的眼睛向来好得出奇，然而他也看不见任何东西，如果水平线上有一片陆地，即使模糊得象水汽一样，肯定地说，水手也能找到的，他仿佛生来就带着一副望远镜。
他们看完了海洋再回过头来看他们下面整个的海岛，吉丁•史佩莱首先问道：
“这个岛大概有多大？”
的确，在这漫无边际的海洋里，它显得并不大。
赛勒斯•史密斯想了几分钟；他仔细地看了一下海岛的周围，考虑到他们所在的高度；然后说：
“朋友们，岛的周围大约有一百多英里，我想是不会错的。”
“那么面积呢？”
“很难估计，”工程师答道，“因为地势太不规则了。”
如果赛勒斯•史密斯估计得不错，那么这个岛就和地中海里的马耳他岛或赞德岛差不多大，不同的是它的地形复杂得多，而海角、地岬、地角、港湾和河流却比较少。这个扁的奇怪的地形特别显眼，吉丁•史佩莱根据工程师的意见把海岛的轮廓画了下来，他们觉得它很象一只奇怪的动物，仿佛是一只极大的海兽躺在太平洋的水面上。
事实上海岛的形状确是这样，掌握了这一点是具有重大意义的，通讯记者立刻就相当正确地画了一张海岛的草图。
海岸的东部——也就是这批遇难的人登陆的地方——形成一个宽阔的港湾，港湾尽头是一个突出的海角。潘克洛夫第一次观察的时候，因为被隆起的地岬遮住，所以没有看见。东北方另外有两个海角围着港湾，海角中间留着一道狭长的海峡，看起来象一只可怕的角蛟半张着嘴。
从东北到西北海岸是弧形的，很象动物的扁平头盖。跟着海岸又往上突起，在地面上高出一大块，但是这部分海岛的形状不很清楚，海岛的中部就是火山。
从这隆起的一点开始，海岸从南到北相当平直，沿岸三分之二的地方，有一条很窄的小河把海岸分开，从小河分割的地方起，海岸就成了长长的一小条，好象大鳄鱼的尾巴。
这根尾巴向海里伸出三十多英里长，形成一个名符其实的半岛。半岛弯曲过来，形成一个可以停泊船只的宽阔海湾，它是这块地形特别的土地上的低海岸部分。
从“石窟”到纬度相同的西海岸的小河，是海岛最狭的地方，距离只有十英里；可是最长的地方，也就是从东北的峡口到西南端的半岛尾部，至少有三十英里。
海岛的内陆大致是这样的，从高山到南部海岸一带树木很多，北部则干燥多沙。在火山和东部海滨之间，出乎赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们的意料，竟发现有一个湖。沿湖生长着许多常绿树，岛上有这种树木，这倒是他们事先没有想到的。从山顶上看过去，这个湖好象和海面一样高，可是工程师衡量了一下，他告诉大家，湖面一定在高约三百英尺的地方，因为海滨向上延伸成一片高地，而湖就在高地上。
“这是一个淡水湖吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“当然，”工程师说，“湖水一定是山里流下来的。”
“看！一条小河往湖里流。”赫伯特指着一条很狭的溪水说，它显然是从西边一带流来的。
“是的，”史密斯说，“既然有小河往湖里输送水，那么在靠海的地方一定有一个出口，湖水大多的时候就从那里排出去。我们回去的时候可以去看看。”
岛上的水系至少包括这条曲折的小河和前面已经提到过的河流，这是探险家们已经看到的。然而，整个的海岛上几乎有三分之二覆盖着树木，形成一片广大的森林，因此也可能有其他的河流从树底下流到海里去，甚至可以这样推论，从这一带看来，这个地区内美丽的温带草木品种实在太多了。北部看不见有任何河流，也许东北部的沼泽地带可能有一些死水；除此以外就是一些沙丘、沙滩和干燥的土地。这和海岛上其余树木茂密的部分比起来，显得太不相同。
火山并不在海岛的正中央，相反的，它耸立在西北部，好象成了这两个地带的分界线；在西南、正南和东南三面，第一部分的支脉都被绿荫遮盖住了。北边就不同，山脉的分支清清楚楚地摆在人的眼前，这些分支一直伸展到沙地的平原上才完。当初火山喷射的时候、就是向这一面冲开一个破口的，大堆的熔岩遍布到形成东北港湾的峡口。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们在山顶上呆了一个钟头。海岛摆在他们的眼睛下面，象一个彩色的立体地形图，绿的代表森林，黄的代表沙地，蓝的代表水。他们把它全部看了一遍，除了绿荫覆盖下的土地、下塌的山谷和火山口的内壁以外，再没有什么隐藏着看不见的地方了。
有一个重要的问题还没有解决，而这个问题的答案对这群遇难人的前途却有极大的影响。
岛上有人吗？
这个问题是通讯记者提出来的，经过一番仔细的观察，答案似乎是否定的。
到处都没有人类开拓过的迹象。没有一簇房舍，没有一幢小屋，海滨上也没有一个渔场，陆地上没有一缕可以证明有人家的轻烟。固然，他们离最远的地方——也就是伸向西南的半岛一还有将近三十英里，即使潘克洛夫的眼睛，也很难看出那里有住宅。海岛四分之三的面积覆盖着森林，他们没法把它揭开来，看看底下是不是藏着稀落的村舍。可是总的看来，他们是落在太平洋里一个空旷的海岛上，这个海岛看来是没有人烟的荒野。
要想最后肯定岛上有没有居民，那还需要经过更加彻底的探索。可是附近的岛屿上是不是经常——至少是偶尔——有土人到这儿来呢？这个问题很难回答。周围五十英里之内看不见陆地。可是不论是马来人的帆船还是玻里尼西亚人的独木舟，要想渡过五十英里的海面都很容易。问题要根据海岛的位置来决定，究竟是孤零零地独立在太平洋里，还是靠近什么群岛？赛勒斯•史密斯不用仪器能算出它们的经纬度来吗？这是困难的。在没有了解情况以前，应当依照附近的土人可能来到的情况作防备。
海岛已经察看完毕了。他们肯定了它的形状，了解了它的地势，算出了它的大小，查清了它的山岳和河流。森林和平原的分布也由通讯记者概括地画下来了。现在只等下山从矿物、动物和植物这三方面来勘察这块土地的资源。
在招呼伙伴们动身以前，赛勒斯•史密斯安详而沉着地对大家说：
“朋友们，我们被上天扔在这一小块土地上了。我们要在这里生活，也许要住很久。如果碰巧有船经过，也可能突然得救。我所以说‘碰巧’，是因为这个海岛太小了。这里甚至连一个可以停船的港口也没有，恐怕我们是在一般船只的航线以外，也就是说，对经常来往太平洋各群岛的船只说来，我们的位置过于偏南，但对绕过合恩角到澳洲去的船只说来，我们又过于偏北了。关于我们的处境我丝毫不打算隐瞒你们……”
“你说得对，亲爱的赛勒斯，”通讯记者兴奋地说。“跟你在一起的都是男子汉大丈夫。我们大家都信任你，你也可以信任大家。对不对，朋友们？”
“我完全听你指挥。”赫伯特抓住工程师的手说。
“不论是什么时候，什么地方，你都是我的主人！”纳布喊道。
“我呢，”水手说，“不管叫我做什么，如果我要哼一声，我就不叫杰克•潘克洛夫，只要你愿意，我们就把这个海岛变成一个小美国！我们要开辟城市，铺筑铁道，拉起电线来打电报。有一天，等到岛上的面貌都改变了，一切都有条有理，变得很文明的时候，我们就把它移交给联合政府。现在我只有一个要求。”
“什么要求？”通讯记者说。
“就是：我们不要把自己当作遇难的人，只当是一群到这儿来开垦的移民。”
史密斯不禁笑了起来，水手的提议被采纳了。于是他向大家表示感谢，并且补充说，他要依靠大家的力量。
“好了，现在我们回‘石窟’去吧！”潘克洛夫大声说。
“等一会儿，朋友们，”工程师说。“我觉得应该给这个海岛，还有我们所看见的那些海角、地岬和河流，起个名字。”
“很好，”通讯记者说。“我们以后会有很多事情要做，有了名字就简单得多了。”
“真的，”水手说，“现在我们来来去去已经有东西可以表达了。至少好象有这么个地方……”
“比方说，‘石窟’吧。”赫伯特说。
“一点儿也不错！”潘克洛夫说。“这个名字最方便了，这完全是我无意中想出来的。我们就把第一次过夜的地方叫做‘石窟’好吗，赛勒斯先生？”
“行，潘克洛夫，既然你给它起了名字，就这么叫吧。”
“好极了！其他的也好办，”水手兴高采烈地说。“赫伯特常跟我说鲁宾逊的故事，我们就模仿着鲁宾逊给这些地方起名字吧，象什么上苍湾、鲸鱼岬、失望角！”
“要不然，用史密斯先生的名字，”赫伯特说，“史佩莱先生的名字，纳布的名字！……”
“我的名字？”纳布露着他雪白晶莹的牙齿说。
“有什么不行呢？”潘克洛夫答道。“纳布港，不很好吗？还有吉丁角……”
“我赞成借用祖国的地名，”通讯记者说，“这样可以使我们不忘记美国。”
“好，对于主要的地方，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我非常赞成这样来给港湾和海洋命名。比方说，我们可以把东边的那个大海湾叫做联合湾，把南边的那个大海湾叫做华盛顿湾；把我们所站的这座山叫做富兰克林山，把我们所瞧见的下面那个湖叫做格兰特湖；再好也没有了，朋友们。我们就用这些名字来怀念我们的祖国，纪念为国增光的那些伟大的公民。至于我们从这座山顶上所看见的那些河流、海湾、海角和地岬，最好还是根据它们形状的特点来命名。这样比较容易记住，而且更加切合实际。这个海岛的样子非常特别。我们要想出一个能表示出它的形状来的东西是不会困难的。各处森林里的河流我们现在虽然还不知道，但是这些森林将来是要去探索的，那些河流以及日后会发现的小溪，我们都可以随发现随命名。朋友们，你们认为怎么样？”
工程师的提议得到了伙伴们的一致同意。海岛象一幅地图似的铺展在他们的眼睛下边，只差给各点各处都起个名字。吉丁•史佩莱把这些名字记下来以后，海岛的地理名称就算正式确定了。
首先，他们根据工程师的提议，把两个港湾命名为联合湾和华盛顿湾，高山命名为富兰克林山。
“现在，”通讯记者说，“我建议把海岛西南的那个半岛叫做盘蛇半岛，把半岛末端的那个弯尾巴叫做爬虫角，因为它很象爬虫的尾巴。”
“同意。”工程师说。
“现在，”赫伯特指着海岛的另一端说，“这个海湾简直跟张开的大鱼嘴一样，我们就把它叫做鲨鱼湾吧。”
“好极了！”潘克洛夫大声说，“我们再把嘴的上下两部分叫做颚骨角，那就丝毫不差了。”
“可是有两个海角呢。”通讯记者说。
“不要紧，”潘克洛夫回答说，“我们可以把它们叫做北颚角和南颚角。”
“都记下来了。”史佩莱说。
“只剩荒岛东南端的海角没有名字了。”潘克洛夫说。
“是联合湾的末端吗？”赫伯特问道。
“就把它叫做爪角吧。”纳布脱口喊道，他也想成为他的一部分领土的教父。
纳布起的名字很恰当，因为这片奇形怪状的陆地就象一只怪兽，而这个海角又正象怪兽坚强有力的利爪。
潘克洛夫对事情的发展感到很满意。气球把他们降落在河水附近，使他们可以喝到这条河的淡水，于是他们很快地就给它想了一个名字，叫做慈悲河，表示对上苍真诚的感谢。遇难的人首先着陆的那个小岛被命名为安全岛，石窟的上方有一个高耸的花岗石峭壁，峭壁的顶端是一块高地，站在那里整个的海湾都在眼前了，他们就把这个高地命名为眺望岗。
最后，他们又把覆盖着盘蛇半岛的整个密林叫做远西森林。
海岛上看得见的和已经知道的地方就这样命名完毕了，将来再有新的发现，还要继续完成这项工作。
至于各个部分的方位，工程师根据观测太阳的高度和方向的结果，大概作了一个测定：联合湾和眺望岗在正东。可是第二天，根据日出和日落的精确时间和记录中午时太阳的位置，他准确地断定了海岛的正北方向，由于海岛在南半球，因此太阳在正过中天的时候，经过的是北边而不是南边，跟在北半球所看到的太阳视动不一样。
所有的工作都已完毕，居民们只等走下富兰克林山回石窟了，这时候潘克洛夫突然大叫起来：
“好哇！我们真是大傻瓜！”
“怎么？”吉丁•史佩莱问道，他已经合上笔记本，站起身来打算走了。
“怎么！我们所在的岛，竟会忘记给它起名字了！”
赫伯特正打算提议用工程师的名字来给海岛命名——伙伴们一定都会同意的——可是这时候赛勒斯•史密斯简单地说：
“朋友们，我们用一个伟大的公民的名字来给它命名吧，这个公民现在正在为保卫美利坚共和国的统一而斗争，我们就把这个岛叫做林肯岛吧！”
大家欢呼了三次，表示拥护工程师的建议。
那天晚上睡觉以前，这群新来的移民谈到他们阔别了的祖国；谈到可怕的流血战争；他们深信南军很快就要失败，有了格兰特将军，有了林肯，北军的事业——也就是正义的事业——一定会胜利的?
这是1865年3月30日的事情。他们想不到在十六天以后，华盛顿会发生一件可怕的阴谋，在受难日的星期五那天，亚伯拉罕•林肯竟死在一个丧心病狂的暴徒手里。
Book 1 Chapter 12
They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater, they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.
That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.
As to the engineer's watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time which he had passed on the downs.
The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun that it must be about nine o'clock in the morning, he put his watch at that hour.
"No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you not?"
"Yes, Cyrus."
"Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is almost that of Washington?"
"Undoubtedly."
"Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very, exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.
"What will be the good of that?" thought the sailor.
They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no difficulty in that.
On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so magnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably had its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very boyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,
"Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!"
It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers should not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he put into his pocket, without making any remark.
"What can he be picking up?" muttered Pencroft. "I have looked in vain for anything that's worth the trouble of stooping for."
Towards ten o'clock the little band descended the last declivities of Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and trees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood. Great blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.
Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks.
"What's the matter, my boy?" asked Spilett.
"Smoke," replied Herbert. "We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred paces from us."
"Men in this place?" cried the reporter.
"We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to deal," replied Cyrus Harding. "I trust that there are no natives on this island; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?"
"Top is on before."
"And he doesn't bark?"
"No."
"That is strange. However, we must try to call him back."
In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the heaps of basalt.
From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the air.
Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter, signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward. They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor which impregnated the atmosphere.
The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.
"This fue," said he, "or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone. There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats."
"Captain!" cried Pencroft. "What a pity that I haven't got a cold!"
The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.
Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch. He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,--
"Its quite simple, my boy," said he, "for, in plunging my hand into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees."
The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some hundred paces off.
There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse.
It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over the sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance, in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the Chimneys.
As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April, which represents the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they were still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which were also covered with the high grass called "tussac" in New Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless, being too low.
"What a pity!" said Herbert, "such a useful tree, and which has such beautiful nuts!"
As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings. Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors, kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories, and various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism, fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped from the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily, they found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as mountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening's dinner.
Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings, some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at Port- Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and magpies which flew away in flocks.
A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and these primitive weapons proved very insufficient.
Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to another like squirrels.
"Kangaroos!" cried Herbert.
"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft.
"Stewed," replied the reporter, "their flesh is equal to the best venison!--"
Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor, followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus Harding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters to pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a chase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more successful than his masters.
"Captain," said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had rejoined them, "Captain, you see quite well we can't get on unless we make a few guns. Will that be possible?"
"Perhaps," replied the engineer, "but we will begin by first manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don't doubt that you will become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters."
"Bows and arrows!" said Pencroft scornfully. "That's all very well for children!"
"Don't be proud, friend Pencroft," replied the reporter. "Bows and arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood. Powder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human race--unhappily."
"Faith, that's true, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "and I always speak too quickly. You must excuse me!"
Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History, reverted to the kangaroos, saying,--
"Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most difficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not mistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat kangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there are about a dozen species."
"Herbert," replied the sailor sententiously, "there is only one species of kangaroos to me, that is 'kangaroo on the spit,' and it's just the one we haven't got this evening!"
They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft's new classification. The honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him.
In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even probable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none would be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account; but Neb watched him and he did well.
Towards three o'clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten seconds later would have been past recognizing in Top's stomach. But fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he was devouring, two other rodents--the animals in question belonged to that order--lay strangled on the turf.
Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand. Their size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled with green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.
The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these rodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their congeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long ears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the agouti.
"Hurrah!" cried Pencroft, "the roast has arrived! and now we can go home."
The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuannas, banksias, and gigantic gum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other arborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the stream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.
Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that they would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a thick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.
The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place was well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed in a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain of verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of sea. The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp outline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several couples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching for fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and reappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre.
As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other on the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.
"This lake is really beautiful!" said Gideon Spilett. "We could live on its borders!"
"We will live there!" replied Harding.
The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way, descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the lake's bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path through the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the hand of mm, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at the north of Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction, and then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the plateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.
To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by the first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how and where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards the north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and doubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short, an immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so, the engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one. They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding had not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist somewhere.
It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.
The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which they did great justice.
The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,--
"My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations."
林肯岛的居民向周围看了最后一眼，就爬下火山口，绕过火山锥，大约半小时之后，他们就到了昨晚过夜的高地，潘克洛夫觉得已经是吃早饭的时候了，于是他们就想到应当把通讯记者的表和工程师的表对一下。
吉丁•史佩莱的表没有被海水侵入，因为他是降落在海水冲不到的沙滩上。这是一件精良的用品，一只非常完好的怀表，通讯记者每天都忘不了小心地给它上发条。工程师的表是在他到沙丘上的那一段时间内停的。
现在工程师给他的表上足了发条，根据太阳的高度确定大概是早上九点钟，于是就把表对在这个时间上。
吉丁•史佩莱也打算按当地时间对表，可是工程师拦住他的手说：
“不，亲爱的史佩莱，等一会儿。你的表是里士满的时间，是不是？”
“是的，赛勒斯。”
“那么说，你表上的时间是根据里士满的子午线确定的。而里士满和华盛顿的子午线又几乎是一样的，对不对？”
“当然。”
“很好，就保持这样吧。每天记住给它上发条，可是不要拨表上的针。这对我们也许有用的。”
“这有什么用处？”水手暗自想道。
他们痛痛快快地吃了一顿，余下的野味和松子全都吃光了。可是潘克洛夫一点也不愁，他们可以一路补充的。给托普吃的一份非常合乎它的胃口，它会在灌木丛中找到新鲜的野味。水手还想要工程师制造一两支猎枪和一些火药，他认为这对工程师讲来一点儿也不困难。
下了高地以后，工程师向伙伴们提议不从原路回“石窟”，而另选一条新路。他想视察一下在树木环抱中的美丽的格兰特湖。于是他们沿着一个支脉的山脊走去，聚成格兰特湖的细流，大概就是从这些支脉之间发源的。居民们在谈话当中已经用新地名了，这些地名大大便利了他们互相表达意思。年轻的赫伯特和天真的潘克洛夫都入了迷，水手一面走一面说：
“嘿，赫伯特！听起来真顺耳！我们不会再走失了，孩子，不管是朝着格兰特湖方向走，还是沿着慈悲河穿过远西森林，我们都一定能走到眺望岗，然后可以到达联合湾！”
大家一致同意，一定等聚齐了再走，决不单独走开。海岛的密林里一定有凶猛可怕的野兽，为了谨慎起见，应该严加提防。在一般的情况下，总是潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布开路，托普在前面带领着大家，每一簇树木之间它都要去钻一钻，通讯记者和工程师并肩走着，吉丁•史佩莱随时准备记录发生的事情，工程师经常很少说话，有时候独自走开去捡些东西，也许是矿物，也许是植物，他总是不言不语地把捡来的东西放在口袋里。
“他在捡些什么呢？”潘克洛夫喃喃地说。“我找来找去也没发现有值得弯腰去捡的东西。”
将近十点钟的时候，小队跨下了富兰克林山的最后一级山坡。这里的树木还很稀疏。他们走过一片黄色的石灰质地面，这种土壤形成一块几乎长达一英里的平原，一直伸展到森林的边缘。大块的玄武岩——根据毕斯可夫的学说，需要经过三亿五千万年，这种岩石才能冷却——散布在平原各处，分布得非常不规则。可是北部山坡上特有的熔岩，这里却一点也没有。
赛勒斯•史密斯打算一路上平安无事地到达小河的源头，他以为小河发源于平原边缘的森林脚下；这时候他忽然看见赫伯特急忙忙地往回跑，纳布和水手躲在岩石后面。
“怎么了，孩子？”史佩莱问道。
“烟，”赫伯特回答说。“我们看见离我们一百步远的地方石头丛里往上冒烟。”
“这儿有人？”通讯记者喊道。
“在不知道对方的来历以前，我们决不能暴露自己，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。“我认为这个岛上是没有土人的，我最怕遇见他们。托普上哪儿去了？”
“托普在前面呢。”
“它没有叫吗？”
“没有。”
“奇怪。可是我们应该想法子把它叫回来。”
工夫不大，工程师、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特就和他们的另外两个伙伴聚在一起了，他们也照样藏在玄武岩的石堆后面。
从那里他们清清楚楚地看见一缕黄烟升向天空。
托普的主人轻轻地吹了一声口哨，把托普喊了回来，他向伙伴们做了一个手势，叫他们等着他，然后就从岩石中悄悄地溜出去了。移民们一动也不动地等待着探听的结果，等得很不耐烦，这时候忽然听见工程师喊了一声，于是他们都急忙向前冲去。他们很快就来到他的跟前，只觉得空气中弥漫着一股触鼻的臭气。
工程师乍看见烟的时候吃了一惊，这并不是毫无理由的，可是这股烟味很容易辨别，他一闻就猜到它的来源了。
“这个火，”他说，“或者说这股烟，完全是自然界产生出来的。那儿有一个硫磺泉，如果我们喉咙痛，一治就好了。”
“史密斯先生！”潘克洛夫喊道。“可惜我没有伤风！”
于是居民们就向着浓烟上升的地方走去。他们看见那里有一个硫磺泉从岩石之间涌出来，泉水吸收了空气中的氧气以后，散发出一股强烈的硫酸味。
赛勒斯•史密斯把手伸到泉水里去，觉得泉水滑腻腻的。他尝了一下，味道相当甜。水的温度他估计有华氏九十五度。赫伯特问他根据什么计算出水的温度来的。
“很简单，孩子，”他说，“因为当我把手伸到水里去的时候，我既不觉得烫，又不觉得凉。所以它的温度和人的体温差不多，而人的体温就在九十五度左右。”
硫磺泉对居民们并没有什么实际用途，于是他们就向着几百步以外的密林边缘走去了。
果然不出他们所料，清澈的河水就是从这里流出来的。小河的两岸很高，都是红土，这种颜色说明土壤里含有氧化铁。根据这个土色，他们马上把小河命名为红河。
这其实是一条大河，河水又深又清，是由山涧水汇合而成的，它半象河水，半象奔流，有时候安静地流过砂石，潺潺作响，有时候冲击在岩石上，或者是从高处直泻下来，形成一个瀑布，从这里流向格兰特湖，长达一英里半以上，宽三十到四十英尺。这条河是淡水，湖里的水想来也是这样的。如果能在湖边找到一个比“石窟”更合适的住所就好了。
水河流出几百英尺以外，两岸有许多树木遮盖着，这些树木多半是美国和塔斯马尼亚温带地区常见的品种，而不是他们在离眺望岗几英里一带探索时所见的松柏科。这时候正是四月初，相当于北半球的十月，也就是初秋，树木的枝叶还很茂盛。林中主要是柽柳和有加利树，其中有的到明年就会产生一种香甜的甘露蜜，和东方的甘露蜜差不多。倾斜的河岸上丛生着澳洲杉，地面还覆盖着一种很高的草，新荷兰把它叫做“袜草”；然而太平洋各群岛盛产的椰子这里却没有，毫无疑问，这是由于纬度太低了。
“真可惜！”赫伯特说，“那么有用的树，果实又那么好！”
飞鸟群集在有加利树和柽柳的疏疏落落的枝杈之间，树枝完全没有遮住它们的翅膀。黑的、白的和灰色的美冠鹦鹉、五颜六色的长尾鹦鹉、浑身闪耀着绿色光泽的红头鱼狗、蓝鹦鹉，以及周围其他各种花花绿绿的飞禽，就好象万花筒似的。它们一面拍着翅膀，一面叽叽喳喳的乱叫，几乎把耳朵都吵聋了。突然，丛林中仿佛举行了一个奇怪的合奏，许多不和谐的声音一齐响了起来。居民们先后听到鸟叫声、野兽吼声，还有一种好象是土人嘴里发出来的声音。纳布和赫伯特向灌木丛冲去，连“必须小心戒备”的最基本原则都忘记了。好在他们在那里既没有发现凶猛的野兽，也没有发现可怕的土人，只看见六只善于模仿各种叫声的鸣禽，也就是所谓山雉。一根棍子准确地打了几下，它们的合奏马上中断了，居民们可以用它们做一顿上好的晚餐。
赫伯特还发现一些美丽的鸽子，它们有的长着青铜色的翅膀，有的长着华丽的冠毛，有的浑身碧绿，很象麦加利港的鸽子，可是要想捉住它们是不可能的，还有那些成群飞翔的乌鸦和喜鹊也同样没法捕捉。
只要有支猎枪，一枪就可以打死它们一大群，可是猎人们手头的投掷武器只有石头，当作枪的只是棍子，这些原始武器实在不能满足打猎的需要。
一会儿又有一群动物在丛林里跑了过去，它们连跑带跳，一跃就是三十英尺，是一种真正的“飞兽”，跳得既快又高，看起来简直和松鼠一样，从一棵树上跳到另外一棵树上；这时候居民们更觉得武器不中用了。
“袋鼠！”赫伯特喊道。
“好吃吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“袋鼠肉啊，”通讯记者说，“炖好了就能抵得过最好的腊味！……”
吉丁•史佩莱这句诱惑人心的话还没有说完，水手就带领着纳布和赫伯特向袋鼠赶去了。赛勒斯•史密斯想把他们喊回来，可是白费力气。这种灵敏的动物看见人来，就象皮球似的跳走了，猎人要想追赶它们，同样也是白费力气。他们赶了五分钟，连气也喘不过来，袋鼠却全部钻入了森林，一只也看不见了。托普比起它的主人们来，也不见得更有办法些。
“史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫等工程师和通讯记者走来以后说，“你看！非造几支枪不可了，你说造得了造不了？”
“也许可能，”工程师答道，“可是我们第一步先要制造一些弓箭，我相信你一定能使用得和澳洲的猎人一样娴熟的。”
“弓箭！”潘克洛夫不屑地说。“那是孩子们的玩意儿！”
“不要骄傲，我的潘克洛夫先生，”通讯记者说。“多少世纪以来，就是弓箭使大地染上了鲜血。火药只不过是不久以前才有的，可是战争呢——不幸得很，可以说有人类以来就有了！”
“不错，说得对，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“我说话老是不加考虑。请你原谅。”
赫伯特一向对他所喜欢的博物学有兴趣，这时候他又回到袋鼠的话题上去了：
“并且，我们现在要对付的又是最难捉的一种，这是一种大袋鼠，长着灰色的长毛；假如我没有记错的话，那么还有黑的和红的袋鼠，岩石袋鼠和鼷，那些袋鼠捉起来比较容易。据统计大概有十二种……”
“赫伯特，”水手直截了当地说，“据我看来，袋鼠只有一种，那就是‘肉叉上的袋鼠’，我们今天晚上偏偏没有捉住！”
他们听了潘克洛夫的新分类法以后，止不住大笑起来。晚上只好吃山雉了，忠实的水手毫不掩饰他心中的遗憾，可是他居然又遇到了一次幸事。
托普为了它本身的利益，到处去搜索，它肚子愈饿，直觉就加倍地灵敏。如果托普私自去打猎的话，恐怕不论是什么野味，只要落在它的爪牙之下，丝毫也不会剩给猎人们；可是现在纳布监视着它，它只好老老实实。
将近三点钟的时候，它钻到灌木丛里不见了，一阵低低的咆哮声说明它在和什么动物揪打。纳布跟着它冲进去，马上就看见托普在拼命地吞食一只小动物，再晚去十秒钟，这只小动物就要整个被它咽下肚去了。幸而托普攻击的是一窝，除了它吃掉了的以外，还有两只啮齿动物（这些动物都属于这一类）软瘫在草地上。
纳布一手提着一只胜利地回来了。它们比兔子稍微大一些，浑身长着黄毛，上面夹杂着绿色的斑点，尾巴退化得剩下短短的一点。
这种啮齿动物的正确名称并没有把这些美国公民难住。它们是刺鼠的一种，叫做“马拉”，比热带地区的同种和美国常见的兔子稍大一些，长着一对长耳朵，和刺鼠不同的是：嘴里一边长着五个臼齿。
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“烤肉来了！我们可以回家了。”
他们停了一会儿又继续往前走。柽柳、山茂和高大的橡胶树形成一个拱门，清澈的红河从下面流过。美丽的丁香树高达二十英尺，还有许多是年轻的自然学家不知道的树木。它们低垂在小河上，河水在夹岸的绿荫下潺潺作响。
这里的河面宽得多了，赛勒斯•史密斯估计他们不久就要到达河口。果然，当他们从一丛美丽的密林下钻出来的时候，就发现已经到了尽头。
探险家们来到格兰特湖的西岸。这里的景色很值得观赏。湖的周围约有七英里，面积在二百五十英亩左右，湖边生长着各种树木。东边几处较高的湖岸有一道美丽如画的苍翠屏障，透过屏障可以看见一线海洋闪闪发光。湖岸的北边显得曲折有致，和南部峻峭的轮廓形成鲜明的对比。这个小小的安大略湖湖畔经常栖息着许多水禽，离南岸几百英尺的湖面有许多岩石露出水来，它们相当于安大略湖里的“千岛”。几对鱼狗和睦地群居在那里，一动也不动地停在一块石头上，静静地期待着游鱼，只要一有发现，就尖叫一声，钻入水底，紧跟着就衔着猎获物出来。岸上和小岛上有许多水禽在大摇大摆地走着，其中有野鸭、塘鹅、水鸡、红嘴鸟、舌头象刷子的水鸟和一两只美丽的琴鸟——它们鲜艳的尾巴张开来，就象“里拉”一样。
这是一个淡水湖，湖水颜色很深，但也很清澈，水面上常常有几处泛起水泡，无数的涟漪一圈圈地荡漾开来，然后又彼此碰在一起，可见水底下游鱼是不会少的。
“这个湖真美！”吉丁•史佩莱说。“我们最好就住在湖滨一带！”
“我们会住在这儿的！”史密斯说。
居民们打算选一条最近的路回“石窟”去，就朝着湖岸南边的拐角处往下走。这里的灌木和丛林从来也不曾有人走过，要想从里面开出一条路来可不简单。他们就这样向海岸走去，打算直到眺望岗的北边。他们披荆斩棘，朝着这个方向前进了两英里，穿过最后一带树木，高地就呈现在他们的眼前了。高地上铺着一层厚厚的绿茵，再向前就是一望无际的海洋。
要想回“石窟”，只要斜穿高地走一英里，然后往下走到慈悲河的第一个拐角处就到了。然而工程师想了解一下湖水涨满了以后是从哪里泄出和怎样泄出去的，于是他们就穿过树木，继续在北探索了一英里半。附近一带大概有瀑布，而且无疑是从花岗石缝中倾泻下去的。简单地说，这个湖是一个极大的中心盆地，小河的流水逐渐把它灌满，湖水必然会形成瀑布流向大海。如果真是这样，工程师认为也许可以利用瀑布的力量，要不然这股水力也是白白地浪费掉。他们于是爬上高地，继续沿着格兰特湖前进，可是循着这个方向走了一英里，赛勒斯•史密斯还是没有发现这个必然存在的瀑布。
这时候已经四点半了。为了准备晚餐，居民们必须回到家里去。于是小队折回原路，沿着慈悲河的左岸回到了“石窟”。
篝火生起来了。纳布和潘克洛夫一向是负责烹调的——一个是黑人，一个是水手，都有这种本领——很快就烤好了一些刺鼠肉，大家都尽情地饱餐了一顿。
晚饭终于吃完了。大家正打算睡觉，赛勒斯•史密斯突然从口袋里拿出几小块不同样的矿石来，他简单地说：
“朋友们，这是铁矿石，这是黄铁矿石，这是陶土，这是石灰石，这是煤。自然界把这些东西供给了我们。能不能好好地利用它们就在我们自己了。明天我们就开始工作。”
Book 1 Chapter 13
"Well, captain, where are we going to begin?" asked Pencroft next morning of the engineer.
"At the beginning," replied Cyrus Harding.
And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin "at the very beginning." They did not possess even the tools necessary for making tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, "having time, husbands her strength." They had no time, since they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they had everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the state of textile material.
It must be said, however, that the settlers were "men" in the complete and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and zeal. He had tried them. He knew their abilities.
Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head and hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him.
Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural sciences, would render greater service to the common cause.
Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable, robust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge, and could not fail to be very useful in the colony.
As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the dockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state, gardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen, fit for anything, he knew how to do everything.
It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to struggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.
"At the beginning," Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in these transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for immediate use, an oven must be built to use it.
"What is this oven for?" asked Pencroft.
"To make the pottery which we have need of," replied Harding.
"And of what shall we make the oven?"
"With bricks."
"And the bricks?"
"With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions, and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food."
"No," replied the reporter; "but if there is a lack of food for want of instruments for the chase?"
"Ah, if we only had a knife!" cried the sailor.
"Well?" asked Cyrus Harding.
"Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be plenty of game in the larder!"
"Yes, a knife, a sharp blade." said the engineer, as if he was speaking to himself.
At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the shore. Suddenly Harding's face became animated.
"Top, here," said he.
The dog came at his master's call. The latter took Top's head between his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he broke it in two, saying,--
"There are two knives, Pencroft!"
Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top's collar was made of a thin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid handles.
The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It was indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one. They set out.
Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of the lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which he possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy, traversed Prospect Heights, and alter a walk of five miles or more they reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.
On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the Indians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped, stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string. This was the "hibiscus heterophyllus," which furnishes fibers of such remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he only wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches, without knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is to say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so easily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance would do the rest.
The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day before. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was no great difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand, then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.
Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself with making them by hand. All that day and the day following were employed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet and hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal size. A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand, which were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or four days.
It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing the orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot where the sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the refraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which it reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four minutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied at this moment would be the north. At the said hour, Cyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior operations.
The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in collecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked up all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with greater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points. It was Top who had famished these points, by bringing in a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to the quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the ends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some cockatoos' feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful archers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys, capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first exploration.
This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with sweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening, was always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot could be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.
During these excursions, which were not extended far from the brick- field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of a large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize the species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.
And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.
The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for the engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient dwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves on the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired workers slept soundly.
They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from that time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday, was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this shore.
On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were collected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform the operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open air, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared fagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried bricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which they contrived air- holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till the evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night, all watching carefully to keep up the fire.
The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of interlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones, which were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.
The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April, the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks.
Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of a kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic use. They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln was supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a manufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln would issue all the products of modern industry.
In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common pottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to which Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular "pipe-clay," with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones of a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of these objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked in a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a number of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully enameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some large pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no tobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. "But tobacco will come, like everything else!" he repeated, in a burst of absolute confidence.
This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed. The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When it suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become smiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all agreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men, scrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation could not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all things.
On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys, carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until they could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate incident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder. It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely inflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash. But, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of the morels which could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting them to the sailor, said,--
"Here, Pencroft, this will please you."
Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair, the leaves being clothed with soft down.
"What's that, captain?" asked Pencroft. "Is it tobacco?"
"No," replied Harding, "it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned, but to us it will be tinder."
When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.
The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of the "caladium macrorhizum," an herbaceous plant of the arum family. They had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something similar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of "Portland sago"; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the settlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess.
When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions went to take the air on the beach. it was eight o'clock in the evening; the night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days before, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those soft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the southern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all the Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of Mount Franklin.
Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at its left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the third magnitude.
Then, after some minutes thought--
"Herbert," he asked of the lad, "is not this the 15th of April?"
"Yes, captain," replied Herbert.
"Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in the year in which the real time is identical with average time; that is to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will pass the meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine I think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an approximation of some degrees."
"Without instruments, without sextant?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Yes," replied the engineer. "Also, since the night is clear, I will try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the height of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the horizon. You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work of installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this land is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance it is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from the principal archipelagoes of the Pacific."
"In fact," said the reporter, "instead of building a house it would be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a hundred miles from an inhabited coast."
"That is why," returned Harding, "I am going to try this evening to calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I will try to calculate the longitude."
If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the angular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there would have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the height of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the meridian, he would obtain the position of the island. But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency.
Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form a pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the wood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach, but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but the Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding resolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights, taking into consideration its height above the level of the sea--a height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of elementary geometry.
The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the river.
This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of the island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon in a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon, lighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against the sky.
At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to the southern pole.
This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the Polar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for it in his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it passed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.
Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the other to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular distance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the angle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a third placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly maintained.
That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the observation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the depression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height of the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha, and consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.
The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o'clock every one was sleeping soundly.
“那么，史密斯先生，我们从哪儿做起呢？”第二天早上潘克洛夫向工程师问道。
“从头做起。”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。
的确，居民们不得不从“第一步”做起。他们连制造工具的基本工具都没有，又不象自然界那样，“有的是时间，可以节省一些气力”。他们没有时间，因为他们必须为自己制造生活中一刻也不能缺少的必需品，虽然他们有许多前辈的经验，用不着自己摸索创造，但还是什么都需要动手去做；他们的钢和铁还在矿石状态中，陶器在陶土状态中，布匹和衣服在纺织原料的状态中。
但是有一点必须说明，这些居民是“人”，而且是不折不扣的万物之灵。工程师史密斯再也找不到比这些伙伴们更聪明更热情的助手了。他了解他们，他知道谁有多大本领。
吉丁•史佩莱是一个精明强干的通讯记者，为了对什么都能谈一套，因此他什么都学。开拓这个孤岛，他的头脑和双手可以发挥很大的作用。他在任何工作前面都不退缩。他是酷爱打猎的猎手，但是现在他要把一向当作消遣的事情变成自己的职业了。
赫伯特是一个勇敢的孩子，他已经具备了相当丰富的自然科学常识，他可以给共同的事业带来很大的好处。
纳布是热诚的化身。他聪明、机智、刚强、健壮，有着钢铁一般的体格，而且还懂得一些打铁的常识，在小队里一定有很大用处。
至于潘克洛夫，他航行过各个海洋，在布罗克林的造船所里当过木匠，在这个州的船上当过助理裁缝，假期中还当过园丁、栽培匠等等。同时他也和所有的水手一样，什么都能干，而且样样都拿得起来。
这五个人都很能和命运作斗争，而且很有把握取得胜利，能把这五个人凑在一起，的确是难得的。
赛勒斯•史密斯已经说过了，要“从头做起”。工程师所说的这个“头”，就是要制造一种器具，用它来改变天然的物质。大家都知道，在这个过程中需要大量的热能。燃料（木柴或是煤炭）随时都有，现在必须做一只炉子。
“做炉子干什么？”潘克洛夫问道。
“用来烧我们所需要的陶器。”史密斯回答说。
“用什么来做炉子呢？”
“用砖头。”
“砖头从哪儿来？”
“用陶土做。我们开始吧，朋友们。为了省事起见，我们就把原料产地辟为工场，纳布管送吃的东西，那里有的是火，可以烹调。”
“不，”通讯记者说，“没有打猎的武器，吃的东西就没有，那怎么办呢？”
“啊，能有一把刀就好了！”水手大声说。
“怎么？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
“是啊！有了刀我马上就可以做一副弓箭。这样，伙食房里就可以有大量的野味了！”
“是的，一把刀，一把快刀……”工程师自言自语地说。
这时候史密斯看见托普正在岸边跑来跑去，突然他的脸上显得奕奕有神。
“托普，过来！”他说。
托普听见主人喊就跑过来了，史密斯用两肘夹着它的头，把它脖子上的套环解了下来，他把它折成两段，说：
“这是两把刀，潘克洛夫！”
水手高兴得欢呼了两声，代替回答。托普的套环是用薄薄的回火钢片做成的，只要在沙石上把它开了口，然后在较细的石头上磨快就行了。海滩上沙石很多，只用了两个钟头，他们就磨好了刀，装上了结实的刀柄，于是小队里就有两把快刀作为工具了。
制成第一批工具以后，他们胜利地欢呼起来。这的确是他们宝贵的劳动成果，而且完成得非常及时。他们出发了。赛勒斯•史密斯建议还是到格兰特湖的西岸去，前一天他曾注意到那里的陶土地，还捡了一点作为标本带回来。于是他们沿着慈悲河，穿过眺望岗，走了五英里多，到达了一块林间空地，这里离格兰特湖还有二百英尺。
赫伯特在路上发现了一种树木，南美洲的印地安人就是用它的树枝做弓的。这就是棕榈科的克里井巴树，这种树的果实不能吃。他们砍了一些又长又直的树枝，捋去树叶，把两头削细，使中段比较粗壮，这样就只等找一种适合的枝条做弓弦了。结果他们找到一棵木槿，它的纤维非常结实，可以和动物身上的筋腱相比。于是潘克洛夫就做成一张相当有力的弓，现在只差箭了。箭杆是很容易做的，他找了一些既硬又直、没有节的树枝就做成了。然而还缺箭头，铁的代用品却不容易找到。潘克洛夫说他已经尽了自己的力量，剩下来的只好碰机会了。
居民们来到了前一天发现的地方。这里遍地都是陶土，对于制造砖瓦非常有用。这项工作并不困难，只要用沙子滤净陶土中的杂质，然后把陶土做成砖头的形状，再用柴火烧一下就行了。
砖坯一般都是用模子压出来的，可是工程师只好用手来做。这件工作一共做了整整两天，工人们把陶土浸在水里，手脚并用，把陶土调和好。然后把它们分成一样大小的一块一块。一个熟练的工人不用机器，十二个钟头可以做一万块左右，可是林肯岛上的这五个制砖工人，两天所做的还不到三千块。他们把制成的砖坯一块挨一块地排在一起，等过三四天完全烧干，就可以用来砌炉子了。
4月2日那天，史密斯测定了海岛的方向，也就是说，找出了日出的确实方位。前一天他就精确地记下了太阳落到水平线下面去的时间，并且把折射差也考虑在内。这天早上，他又同样精确地记录了太阳升起来的时间。从日出到日落一共是十二小时二十四分。因此在日出以后六小时十二分的时候，这一天的太阳应该正通过子午线，这时候它在天空的方位就是正北。
到了上述的时间，赛勒斯就把这一点记了下来，找出和太阳连成一条直线的两棵树，这两棵树可以帮助他确定方位。他一个人默默地做好这件工作，就这样找出了当地永恒的子午线。
在炉子做好以前的两天，居民们搜集了大量的燃料。他们把林间空地附近的树枝全砍了下来，还捡回了所有掉在树底下的枯枝。潘克洛夫现在有了几打带尖头的箭，打猎也比较顺利了。这些箭头是通过托普而得来的。它猎回一只豪猪来，这只豪猪肉虽然不好吃，然而它身上竖满了的硬刺却非常宝贵。把这些硬刺装在箭头上，再加上一些美冠鹦鹉的羽毛，射起来就十分准确有效了。通讯记者和赫伯特很快就成为技术娴熟的神弓手。从此“石窟”里有了各种各样的大量野味，例如：水豚、鸽子、刺鼠、松鸡等等。这些动物大部分都是从慈悲河左岸的森林地带打来的，他们把这部分森林命名为啄木鸟林，因为潘克洛夫和赫伯特第一次出来探险的时候，曾经在这里追逐过一只啄木鸟。
这些野味他们大都鲜吃了，可是也留了一部分水豚腿。他们先用清香的树叶把水豚腿裹上，然后用柴火熏烤。这种食品虽然非常富有养分，但是他们今天烤，明天烤，大家都很希望火炉上能有一些熬汤的声音；这必须等到能够制造锅子的时候，也就是，必须等到炉子造好以后。
这几次出猎都没有离开制砖场很远。有一次，猎人们在途中发现了大动物新近留下的足迹，这些动物脚爪很有力，但是他们认不出是哪一类野兽。赛勒斯•史密斯要大家谨慎一些，森林里大概有许多猛兽。
他的指示是正确的。果然，有一天吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特看见一只野兽，它的样子很象美洲豹。幸而它没有扑过来，要不然他们即使能够侥幸逃脱，也免不了身受重伤。吉丁•史佩莱决定一旦有了一件正式的武器——也就是潘克洛夫所要的枪——就要和这些猛兽拼命，把荒岛上的猛兽全部消灭。
这几天他们并没有整修“石窟”，因为工程师希望能找到一个比较更方便的住所，必要的时候，可以自己建筑一座。他们暂时就在通道的沙地上铺了一层地苔和枯叶，没有作进一步的打算，工作累了以后，就熟睡在这些原始的床铺上。
他们把在林肯岛上所度过的日子计算了一下，从那时候开始，他们就保持了每天记日志，4月5日星期三，这是风暴把遇难的人扔在海岸上以后的第十二天。
4月6日，天刚破晓的时候，工程师和他的伙伴们就在林间空地上集合，打算在这里烧砖。这种工作通常不是在窑里而是在露天的地方进行的，凝结的砖坯砌成一个大窑，然后再用这个窑来烧砖坯本身。他们把捆好的木柴放在地上，把已经干了的砖坯成排地围在燃料外面，很快就围成一个立方形，在立方形的最外一层，又开了几个通气孔。这项工作整整进行了一天，直到傍晚，他们才开始在柴捆上点火。当天晚上大家都没有睡觉，全体都小心地照顾柴火，不使它熄灭。
烧砖工作继续了四十八小时，结果完全成功。接着还需要等热气腾腾的半成品冷却下来，在这期间，纳布和潘克洛夫由赛勒斯•史密斯带领着到湖的北边去，把那里的石灰石和普通的石头用一个树枝编成的筐子装了一大批回来。经过加热，它们就分解成一种浓度很强的生石灰，经过沸化，生石灰的体积大大膨胀了。它们的质地非常纯粹，至少和白垩或碳酸钙烧成的一样。把石灰和细沙搅拌在一起，就成了上等的灰泥。
分别做了这些准备工作，到4月9日那天，工程师就有了不少熟石灰和几千块砖头可以使用了。
他们抓紧时间，立刻开始砌窑，预备焙烧他们日常生活中不可缺少的陶器。他们没有遇到多大困难就成功了，五天以后，窑里就烧起了煤——这是工程师在红河河口一带露天的地方发现的。第一缕炊烟从二十英尺高的烟囱里升了起来。林间空地变成了一个作坊，潘克洛夫甚至认为这个土窑里可以做出各种现代化的工业品来，这种想法倒也并不过分。
在这期间，居民们首先制造出一只烹调用的陶土罐。主要原料是陶土，史密斯在里面加了一些石灰和石英混合起来就成了正式的“管土”。他们拿适当形状的石头作模子，用陶土做成饭碗、茶杯，另外又做了一些盛水的大壶等等。这些陶器看起来很笨重，而且很不美观，可是经过高温焙烧以后就不同了，“石窟”的厨房里添了不少器皿，居民们把它们看得和最精致的上釉瓷器一样宝贵。必须提到，潘克洛夫为了想知道这种陶土配不配称得上“管土”，就做了几只大烟斗，结果他感到非常满意，遗憾的是没有烟叶，这一点使他非常气恼。“别的东西可以找到，烟草也一定会找到的！”他信心十足地重复着。
这项工作一直继续到4月15日，中间一点也没浪费时间。居民们一下子都变成陶土匠了，成天只做陶器。什么时候赛勒斯•史密斯认为应该做铁匠活了，他们就会变成铁匠。可是第二天是星期日，而且是复活节，大家都同意休假一天。
4月15日傍晚，他们把陶器运到“石窟”，炉子已经熄灭了，等以后有新的用途时再烧。他们回去的时候，遇见一件值得庆幸的事；工程师发现一种可以代替火绒的东西。他从一种多孔菌科的植物上取得一种海绵状的柔软菌肉。这种菌子经过适当的加工，特别是事先使它沾上火药，或者是在硝酸盐或氯化钾的溶液里煮沸以后，非常容易燃烧。以前，他们始终没有找到这样的多孔菌，也没有找到一种可以代用的食用菌。这天工程师看见一种艾属的植物——主要品种是苦艾、薄荷、茵陈蒿等等——他采集了几把递给水手说：
“拿去，潘克洛夫，这回你该高兴了。”
潘克洛夫仔细看了一下，这种植物上有许多光亮的长须，叶子上满布着软毛。
“这是什么，史密斯先生？”潘克洛夫问道。“是烟草吗？”
“不是，”史密斯回答说，“是苦艾，学者们把它叫做中国艾，可是我们要把它当火绒用。”
等苦艾干燥到相当程度以后，特别是当工程师事后把它在硝酸盐溶液里浸透了以后，它就成为一种非常容易燃烧的引火材料了。至于硝酸盐，事实上就是硝石，岛上有很多这样的矿层。
这一天，移民们的晚餐非常丰盛：纳布炖了一锅刺鼠肉汤，还有一只熏水豚腿。他在熏腿上加了一些煮熟了的“贝母属”块茎，这种白星海芋属的草本植物，非常好吃，而且富于营养，有点象英国所卖的“朴德兰西米”，现在可以拿它当面包吃，因为林肯岛上的居民们，到目前为止还没有面包。
吃完晚饭，在临睡以前，史密斯和他的伙伴们到海滩上去散步。这时候是晚上八点钟，夜色非常优美。这是满月以后的第五天，月亮还没有升起来，可是水平线上已经泛起了一片银白色柔和的光辉。那可以算是月亮的“曙光”。周极星在南边的天顶上闪闪发光，其中最显著的就是南十字座。几天以前，工程师曾经在富兰克林山顶上看到它。
赛勒斯•史密斯对着这美丽的星座注视了很久，它的上下两端各有一颗一等星，左边有一颗二等星，右边有一颗三等星。
他考虑了几分钟，然后向少年问道：
“赫伯特，今天是4月15日吗？”
“是的，史密斯先生。”赫伯特说。
“一年之中，一共有四天实际时间和平均时间完全相等，假如我没有记错的话，明天就是其中的一天，也就是说，孩子，在明天钟刚打十二点的时候，太阳在几秒钟之内正经过子午线。如果天气好，我想大体上可以准确地算出海岛的经度来，至多也不会相差几度。”
“不用仪器，不用六分仪吗？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“不用，”工程师说。“并且，今天晚上的夜色非常清朗，我现在就要计算南十字座的高度，也就是说，根据水平线上的天极，想法子把我们的纬度求出来。要知道，朋友，在没有认真地进行确定方位的工作以前，我们还不能肯定这片陆地是一个孤岛；我们必须尽可能精确地知道它和美洲、大洋洲、或是太平洋主要群岛的距离。”
“的确，”通讯记者说，“万一我们离有人居住的海岸还不到一百英里，那么造一只船就比盖一所房子更加重要了。”
“所以，”史密斯说，“今天晚上我要想法子算出林肯岛的纬度来，明天中午我再想法子求经度。”
于是史密斯回到“石窟”里去。他在火光下，削了两把小平板尺，把它们的一端连接起来，做成一副圆规。圆规的两只脚可以分开，也可以合在一起，连接的部分是用柴堆里找来的一枚结实的橡胶树刺钉在一起的，仪器做好了，工程师又回到海滩上去。然而天极的高度必须在没有云的水平线上测量，也就是说，要在海面上测量，而南方的水平线又被爪角挡住了，因此他只得另找一个比较合适的地点。最合乎理想的地方显然是正对着南方的海岸，但是那需要费一些事，渡过慈悲河。史密斯最后决定就在眺望岗上进行观察，他自然也考虑到高地的海拔高度——他打算第二天再用几何学的基本原理，把高地的高度求出来。
于是居民们爬上慈悲河的左岸，到高地上去了。他们站在高地的边缘，也就是从西北到东南的沿河一带奇形怪状的石头上。
这一带高地前面就是慈悲河左岸的山岗。这片山岗一直向着爪角的尽头和荒岛的南部低斜下去。他们一眼看过去，从爪角到爬虫角整个半圆形的水平线上都可以看得清清楚楚，没有任何东西遮挡。初升的月亮照亮了南边的水平线，在天空的衬托下，这部分水平线显得十分清晰。
这时候，南十字座出现在观察家的眼前了，十字架二倒置在星座的底部，也就是离南极较近的地方。
这个星座离南极比北极星离北极远。十字架二大约在距南极27度的方位，赛勒斯•史密斯知道这一点，在计算的时候就把这个角度估计在内了。当十字架二经过正对着南极的子午线时，他也仔细地进行了观察，这样工作就简单了。
赛勒斯•史密斯把圆规的一只脚对着水平线，另一只脚对着十字架二，两只规脚之间的距离，就形成了十字架二和水平线之间的角距。为了把所得的这个角度固定下来，他用刺针把一根木条横钉在圆规的两只脚上，这样就可以把它们之间的角度适当地保留下来。
做完了这一步工作，下一步只要计算一下角度就行了。但是首先要把水平线的俯角考虑在内，因此必须再到海平面上去进行观察，量一下峭壁的高度。有了上述的角度就可以求出十字架二的高度，从这里也可以求出天极在水平线上的高度，也就是海岛的纬度，困为地球上任何一个地方的纬度都永远等于当地天极在水平线上的高度。
计算工作留在第二天进行，到十点钟的时候，大家就都睡熟了。
Book 1 Chapter 14
The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the necessary materials--soda or potash, fat or oil. The important question of renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time and place. At any rate their clothes would last at least six months longer, for they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor. But all would depend on the situation of the island with regard to inhabited land. This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted.
The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season.
It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.
"Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?" said Herbert to the engineer.
"No, my boy," replied the latter, "we are going to proceed differently, but in as precise a way."
Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to the beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied themselves in different ways.
Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet long, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with his own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb-line which Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened to the end of a flexible fiber. Having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff, which rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the plumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.
That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand, his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little stick.
Then addressing Herbert--"Do you know the first principles of geometry?" he asked.
"Slightly, captain," replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself forward.
"You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?"
"Yes," replied Herbert; "their homologous sides are proportional."
"Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled triangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular pole, the distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the pole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides the perpendicular cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the distance which separates the little stick from the bottom of the cliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be prolongation of that of the first triangle."
"Ah, captain, I understand!" cried Herbert. "As the distance from the stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff."
"Just so, Herbert," replied the engineer; "and when we have measured the two first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have a sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff, and will save us the trouble of measuring it directly."
The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose length above the sand was exactly ten feet.
The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place where the pole was thrust into the sand.
The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was five hundred feet.
These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the Chimneys.
The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one of his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy to trace figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the following proportions:--
15:500::10:x
500 x 10 = 5000
5000 / 15 = 333.3
From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in height.
Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening before, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance between the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the opening of this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal parts. Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which separated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of the sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been made, was found to be fifty- three degrees. These fifty-three degrees being subtracted from ninety degrees--the distance from the pole to the equator--there remained thirty- seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded, therefore, that Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree of the southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the imperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it must be situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel.
There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the island would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same day, at twelve o'clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.
It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an exploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of the lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their discoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible. They would breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.
At half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel. On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely strutting. They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much resembles the braying of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in an eatable point of view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their flesh, though blackish, is not bad food.
Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand; seals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of refuge. It was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary point of view, for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus Harding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea, he announced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the islet. The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would have rejoiced the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the phasianella, the terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was the discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the rocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys.
"Neb will not have lost his day," cried Pencroft, looking at the spacious oyster-bed.
"It is really a fortunate discovery," said the reporter, "and as it is said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs, we shall have an inexhaustible supply there."
"Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing," said Herbert.
"No," replied Harding. "The oyster contains very little nitrogen, and if a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than fifteen to sixteen dozen a day."
"Capital!" replied Pencroft. "We might swallow dozens and dozens without exhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?"
And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would be approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs. They put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had manufactured, and which already contained food; they then continued to climb the coast between the downs and the sea.
From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in time for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.
All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point which closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South Mandible. Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with debris of lava. A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls, great albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great fancy. He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result, for they seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing.
This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,--
"You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we shall never get anything!"
"Doubtless, Pencroft," replied the reporter, "but it depends on you. Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter. coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate, and lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns."
"Oh!" replied the engineer, "we might, no doubt, find all these substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs very particular tools. However, we shall see later!"
"Why," cried Pencroft, "were we obliged to throw overboard all the weapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our pocket- knives?"
"But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have thrown us to the bottom of the sea!" said Herbert.
"What you say is true, my boy," replied the sailor.
Then passing to another idea,--"Think," said he, "how astounded Jonathan Forster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found the place empty, and the machine flown away!"
"I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought," said the reporter.
"It was all my idea, that!" said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.
"A splendid idea, Pencroft!" replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, "and which has placed us where we are."
"I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners," cried the sailor, "especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and join us again."
"So would I, truly!" replied the reporter. "Besides, what do we want? Nothing."
"If that is not--everything!" replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging his shoulders. "But, some day or other, we shall find means of going away!"
"Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends," remarked the engineer, "if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island, or from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its southern part. The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New Zealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the east. But between these two countries, there is a distance of at least six thousand miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point in this great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently, with a sufficient approximation, I hope."
"Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in latitude?" asked Herbert.
"Yes," replied the engineer, "but the distance which separates us from it is more than twelve hundred miles."
"And that way?" asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme interest, pointing to the south.
"That way, nothing," replied Pencroft.
"Nothing, indeed," added the engineer.
"Well, Cyrus," asked the reporter, "if Lincoln Island is not more than two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?"
"Well," replied the engineer, "instead of building a house we will build a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command--"
"Well then," cried the sailor, "I am quite ready to be captain--as soon as you can make a craft that's able to keep at sea!"
"We shall do it, if it is necessary," replied Cyrus Harding.
But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking, the hour approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus Harding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of the island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess.
The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from that part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his enigmatical preservation. They halted at this place and prepared for breakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert went for some fresh water from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which Neb had provided.
During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical observation. He chose a clear place on the shore, which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level. This bed of fine sand was as smooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of little importance whether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the stick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On the contrary, the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to say, in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must not be forgotten that the settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was situated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon.
Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to ascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the meridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south. It was by means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for want of an instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result which he wished to obtain.
In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length would be exactly twelve o'clock, and it would be enough to watch the extremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, alter having successively diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his stick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow longer, and consequently its modifications would be more easily ascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is, the more easily can the movement of its point be followed. The shadow of the stick was nothing but the needle of a dial. The moment had come, and Cyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he stuck into the sand, he began to mark the successive diminutions of the stick's shadow. His companions, bending over him, watched the operation with extreme interest. The reporter held his chronometer in his hand, ready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its shortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of April, the day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour given by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which would simplify the calculation. Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced, the shadow slowly diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that it was beginning to increase, he asked, "What o'clock is it?"
"One minute past five," replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had now only to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be seen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours between the meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o'clock in the evening in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement round the earth, traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen degrees an hour. Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees.
Then, since Washington is 77deg 3' 11" as much as to say seventy-seven degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans take for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the English--it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and seventy-five degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say, on the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude.
Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into consideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he believed he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island was between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and between the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth meridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich.
The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was, it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles to a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position.
But this error would not influence the determination which it was necessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a distance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail boat.
In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand five hundred miles from the American coast!
And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in any way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the situation assigned to Lincoln Island.
第二天4月16日是复活节的星期日，居民们天一亮就从“石窟”里出来，去洗衣服。工程师打算只要找到必要的原料——小苏打或是钾碱，脂肪或是油料——立刻就开始制造肥皂。至于换新衣服，这是一个重要的问题，应该找个适当的时间地点来讨论。他们的衣服很结实，即使体力劳动天天磨损，至少还可以维持六个月，可是一切都要看海岛是不是靠近有人居住的陆地了。如果今天天晴的话，这一点就可以得到解决。
太阳从清晰的水平线上升起来，告诉人们一个晴天到来了。这是一个美丽的秋日，好象温暖季节要离别了，特意给人留个纪念似的。
现在必须测量峭壁的海拔高度，以便完成昨天晚上的观察。
“你不需要一个象昨天晚上用的圆规那样的仪器吗？”赫伯特对工程师说。
“不，孩子，”工程师答道，“我们要换一种方法，只是要做得和昨天一样准确才行。”
只要有机会，赫伯特什么都想学，所以他跟着工程师一起往海滨去了。潘克洛夫、纳布和通讯记者还留在原地做别的工作。
赛勒斯•史密斯准备了一根笔直的木杆，他对自己的身长知道得分毫不差，于是就比比他的身高精确地算出木杆的长度是十二英尺。赫伯特拿着史密斯交给他的垂线，这是用柔韧的植物纤维做成的，一端系着一块石头。他们走到离开海边二十英尺，距垂直的峭壁将近五百英尺的地方，史密斯就小心地把木杆插入沙地二英尺深，他利用垂线使木杆和地面保持垂直。
做完这步，他就后退了一段相当距离，然后趴在沙滩上，在这里眼睛可以同时看到木杆的顶端和峭壁的上沿。他仔细地用一根小棍子在观察点做了一个记号，然后对赫伯特说：
“你知道几何学最基本的原理吗？”
“稍微知道一些，史密斯先生。”赫伯特说，他一点也不想表现自己。
“你记得两个相似三角形应该具备的条件吗？”
“记得，”赫伯特答道，“它们的对应边成比例。”
“好，孩子，我刚做出两个相似的直角三角形，第一个比较小，它的三边是：那根垂直的木杆和从这根小棍子到木杆底部的距离，我的视线就是三角形的斜边，第二个三角形的三边是：垂直的峭壁——我们想测量的也就是它的高度——这根小棍子和峭壁底部之间的距离，和同样是由我的视线所形成的三角形斜边，这斜边也就是第一个三角形斜边的延长线。”
“啊，史密斯先生，我明白了！”赫伯特大声说。“小棍子和木杆之间的距离比小棍子和峭壁底部之间的距离，就等于木杆的高度比峭壁的高度。”
“一点儿也不错，赫伯特，”工程师说，“我们已经知道木杆的长度，再量一下两段水平距离，然后按照比例一算，就可以求出峭壁的高度，省得直接去测量了。”
他们利用木杆量出了两段水平距离，木杆在沙滩上的高度是十英尺整。
第一段距离是从小棍子到插木杆的地方，相距十五英尺。
第二段距离是从小棍子到峭壁底部，相距五百英尺。
量完以后，赛勒斯•史密斯就和少年回“石窟”去了。
工程师拿出一块平板石来，这是他有一次出外打猎的时候带回来的。这块石头就象一块石板，很容易用尖利的贝壳在上面划出字码来。他求出了以下的比例：
15:500＝10:X 500×10＝5000 6000&divide;15＝333.3
由此得出，花岗石峭壁的高度是三百三十三英尺。
然后赛勒斯•史密斯就把前一天晚上做的仪器拿了出来，圆规两脚之间的距离就是十字架二和水平线之间的角距。他首先把一个圆周分成三百六十等分，然后非常精确地把圆规角度落在圆周上，得出的结果是10度。在这个角度上加上十字架二距离南极的27度，再减去观察的时候所在的峭壁上离海面高度的值，就得出一个37度的角来。南极与水平线之间相距90度，从90度里减去53度还剩下37度。因此，赛勒斯•史密斯测量的结论是：林肯岛在南纬37度线上。如果把计算时不精确的程度估计在内，假设误差有五度，那么海岛的位置一定在南纬35度与40度之间。
现在只等算出经度，就可以确定海岛的位置了。工程师打算就在这天的中午十二点钟，太阳经过子午线的时候进行试验。
他们决定星期日出去旅行，也就是到湖的北边和鲨鱼湾之间那一带去探险。如果时间来得及，他们就继续向南颚角的北边前进。预定在沙丘上吃早饭，直到傍晚再回来。
八点半钟的时候，小队沿着海峡的边缘前进。对面的安全岛上许多飞鸟在大摇大摆地走着。它们的叫声活象驴子，一听就知道是潜水鸟。潘克洛夫只是从吃的观点来看它们。他很满意，因为这种鸟的肉虽然黑一些，吃起来味道却不错。
他们还望见一些巨大的两栖动物在沙地上爬行着，毫无疑问，那是海豹。它们大概是打算在小岛上安家，这种动物是不可能从吃的观点来看的，因为海豹的肉非常油腻，不好吃。可是赛勒斯•史密斯还是很仔细地看着它们，他没有说出自己怎样想，只是告诉大家，不久他们要到小岛上去一次。海滩上散布着无数的贝壳，有的如果让贝壳学家看见了，一定会心花怒放；其中有酸浆贝、三角蛤等等。可是更实惠的是：纳布在退潮的时候，在距离“石窟”将近五英里的岩石丛中发现了一大片蛤蜊场。
“纳布这一天真没有白过。”潘克洛夫看着这一大片的蛤蜊场说。
“这个发现真运气，”通讯记者说，“据说每只蛤蜊每年能产卵五万到六万个，这样我们就永远也吃不完了。”
“我只知道蛤蜊并没有什么营养。”赫伯特说。
“不错，”史密斯说。“蛤蜊里面所含的蛋白质很少，如果一个人成天单吃蛤蜊，那每天至少需要吃十五到十六打才行。”
“好极了！”潘克洛夫说。“我们可以拼命的吃，反正这里的蛤蜊是吃不完的。我们要带一些当早饭吗？”
水手和纳布知道大家一定赞成，不等回答，就捡了一大堆的蛤蜊。他们把蛤蜊装在纳布用木槿纤维做的一只网袋里，跟原来已经装着的其他食物放在一起，然后他们继续爬上沙丘和大海之间的海滨。
史密斯不时地看表，以便准时观察太阳，这项工作必须在正午进行。
海岛的这部分，直到联合湾尽头的南颚角，全都很荒芜。这里什么也看不见，满眼尽是沙石和贝壳，夹杂着一些熔岩的碎片。只有一些海鸟常到这一带荒凉的海岸上来，例如海鸥、巨大的信天翁和野鸭，潘克洛夫对于野鸭非常向往。他想用箭射几只下来，可是没有成功，野鸭难得停下来，他还没有本领在它们飞的时候射中它们。
于是水手又对工程师说：
“你瞧，史密斯先生，如果没有一两支猎枪，我们这辈子也打不到什么东西的！”
“那当然没有疑问，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者说，“可是这要靠你。你给我们找一些铁来做枪身，钢做撞针，硝石、炭和硫磺做火药，水银和硝酸做雷汞，铅做子弹，有了这些，就是最新式的枪，赛勒斯也能给我们做出来。”
“噢！”工程师答道，“肯定地说，岛上是可以找到这些东西的。不过枪的构造非常精致，需要有特殊工具才能制造。我们以后再说吧！”
“那么，”潘克洛夫大声说，“当时我们为什么要把吊篮里所有的武器，所有的用具，连我们的小刀都扔出去呢？”
“假如当时不把它们扔出去，潘克洛夫，气球就要把我们沉到海底下去了！”赫伯特说。
“嗯，你说的也是实话，孩子。”水手说。
然后，水手又想起了别的问题。
“你想，”他说，“约拿旦•福斯特和他的伙伴第二天早上发现人跑了，气球也飞了，一定要急死了！”
“我才不管他们呢。”通讯记者说。
“这都是我的主意！”潘克洛夫得意洋洋他说。
“这个主意真不错，潘克洛夫！”吉丁•史佩莱笑道，“它把我们弄到这儿来了。”
“我宁可在这儿，也不愿意在南方人的手里，”水手大声说，“尤其是史密斯先生又回到我们这里来了。”
“我也这样想，真的！”通讯记者说。“并且，我们还想要什么呢？什么也不缺了。”
“假如不是这样的地方……什么都需要了！”潘克洛夫耸耸肩笑道。“再说，总有一天，我们要想法子离开这儿的！”
“如果林肯岛离开有人居住的海岛或大陆只是一般的距离，”工程师说，“那么，朋友们，这个日子也许会比你们所想的来得早一些。林肯岛的位置一个钟头之内我们就可以知道了。我没有太平洋的地图，可是太平洋南部地理我脑子里记得很清楚。根据昨天我所测出的纬度，林肯岛的西边是新西兰，东边是智利的海岸。可是这两个国家中间相距至少有六千英里。因此，必须肯定这个岛究竟在这一大片海洋中的哪一点，这一点我们马上就可以从经度上知道了，我相信可能相当准确。”
“帕摩图群岛是在同一纬度上离我们最近的地方吗？”赫伯特问道。
“是的，”工程师答道，“可是我们离它还在一千二百英里以上。”
“那边呢？”纳布指着南方，别人的谈话使他很感兴趣。
“那边什么也没有。”潘克洛夫回答说。
“不错，什么也没有。”工程师补充道。
“赛勒斯，”通讯记者问道，“如果林肯岛距离新西兰或是智利不到两三千英里呢？”
“那么，”工程师回答说，“我们就不盖房子，先造船，由潘克洛夫来指挥……”
“好哇，”水手大声说，“我随时准备着当船长——只等你做一只能够航海的船！”
“必要的话，我们就造一只。”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说。
的确，这些人遇事从来也不慌张，他们谈着谈着，观测的时间渐渐地接近了。赫伯特始终猜不出赛勒斯•史密斯不用任何仪器怎么能确定太阳通过海岛子午线的路线。
这时候观测家们离“石窟”大约走了六英里，距工程师在神秘地得救之后而被他们找到的那部分沙丘不远。他们在这里停下来，准备吃饭，这时候已经十一点半了。赫伯特向附近的一条小河跑去，用纳布带来的一只瓶子装了些淡水回来。
在准备吃饭的时候，史密斯把所有的东西都安排好了，打算进行天文观察。他在海滨选了一片开阔的地方，这里落潮以后，地面非常平整。这片细沙地和冰面一样平滑，甚至没有一粒沙子象是摆错了地方。至于地面是不是水平，那倒无关紧要，同时，插在地上的那根六英尺高的标杆是不是和地面垂直，也没有多大关系。相反的，工程师还把它歪向南边，也就是海滨背着太阳的方向，因为有一点必须记住：由于海岛在南半球，所以林肯岛上的居民所看见的太阳运行的弧线不在南边的水平线上，而是在北边。
现在赫伯特明白工程师打算怎样确定太阳的中天，也就是经过海岛子午线的方位了。所谓经过海岛子午线的方位，换句话说，就是当地的正南方。他的方法是测量一根标杆在沙地上的投影，在没有仪器的条件下，这个方法可以使他得到他所想求得的相当准确的结果。
按道理，当影子的长度缩到最短的时候，应该正是中午十二点钟，仔细地看着影子的末端，就可以找出影子在逐渐缩短以后，又开始伸长的一刹那。赛勒斯•史密斯把标杆偏向和太阳相对的方向，就可以使影子长一些，因此它的变化就更加容易看清了。日晷的时针愈长，针点的移动也就愈加容易辨别。标杆的影子也就相当于日晷上的指针。
赛勒斯•史密斯估计时间到了，就跪在沙地上，标杆影子逐渐缩短，他就用小木桩一个一个地随着影子插在地上作为标志。他的伙伴们怀着极大的兴趣，弯着腰注视着工作的进行。通讯记者手里拿着表，随时准备报告影子缩到最短时的时刻。还有一点需要说明，赛勒斯•史密斯进行观测的这天是4月16日，这一天的正式时间和平均时间完全相同，因此吉丁•史佩莱的表上的时间，也就是当时华盛顿的真实时间，这样计算起来就简单了。这时候，随着太阳的移动，影子也逐渐缩短，等赛勒斯•史密斯发现影子开始往回长起来的时候，他就问道，“什么时候？”
“五点零一分。”吉丁•史佩莱马上答道。
他们现在只差把结果计算出来。没有比这个更容易的了。由此可见华盛顿和林肯岛的经差大约是五小时，也就是说，林肯岛中午的时候，华盛顿已经是傍晚五点钟了。太阳环绕地球的视动每过一度需要四分钟，也就是一小时移动15度。15度乘5（小时）等于75度。
华盛顿的经度既然是77度3分11秒，也就是从格林威治子午线——美国和英国都以格林威治为经线的起点——算起的第77度，由此可以算出：海岛一定在格林威治子午线以西77度加75度，也就是西经152度的地方。
赛勒斯•史密斯向伙伴们宣布了这个结果，同时，也象计算纬度时一样，估计了观察时可能发生的误差。他相信他可以肯定林肯岛的位置在纬度35度到40度之间，经度在格林威治子午线以西150到155度之间。
可以看出，在观察中，他估计可能发生的误差是上下五度，一度合六十英里，在实际位置上，经纬线五度可能形成的差错也就是三百英里。
可是这个误差并不影响所要知道的推断。显然林肯岛距离任何一个国家和岛屿都非常远，如果打算乘一只小船到那里去，那未免太冒险了。
根据计算的结果，这个海岛实际上离泰地岛和帕摩图群岛至少有一千二百英里，离新西兰一千八百多英里，和美国的西海岸相距四千五百英里以上!
赛勒斯•史密斯回忆了一下，他想不起在太平洋的这部分有什么岛屿靠近林肯岛。
Book 1 Chapter 15
The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor's first words were addressed to Gideon Spilett.
"Well, sir," he asked, "what shall we do to-day?"
"What the captain pleases," replied the reporter.
Till then the engineer's companions had been brickmakers and potters, now they were to become metallurgists.
The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point of Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long series of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There were no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two capes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered the Chimneys; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely settled.
The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous Island was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it, especially at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly declared this. Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary tools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they must begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc., which would take some time. It was decided, therefore, that they would winter at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter months.
Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron ore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest part of the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or into steel.
Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the most part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case with the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of magnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret of iron. It was, therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must reduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in a pure state. This reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to a high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method, which has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single operation, or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then changes it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of coal, which is combined with it.
Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as possible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and rich. It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a deep gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the regular octahedron. Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron of the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and Norway are so abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein of coal already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the manufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the treatment of the ore. This is the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great Britain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal extracted from the same soil at the same time as itself.
"Then, captain," said Pencroft, "we are going to work iron ore?"
"Yes, my friend," replied the engineer, "and for that--something which will please you--we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet."
"A seal hunt!" cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. "Are seals needed to make iron?"
"Since Cyrus has said so!" replied the reporter.
But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared for the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.
Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were soon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford passable at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it without getting wet higher than the knee.
Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions for the second time.
On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them. The hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they were not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to frighten the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths off. They also respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings were reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented with feathers of a scaly appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently advanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with little holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds. Towards the extremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above the water, having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion.
These were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary, however, first to allow them to land, for with their close, short hair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement.
Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send them to sleep. They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock them on the head.
The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited silently.
An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could count half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of the islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat. During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the rocks, glided towards the future scene of combat.
All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted. The engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest regained the sea in safety.
"Here are the seals required, captain!" said the sailor, advancing towards the engineer.
"Capital," replied Harding. "We will make bellows of them!"
"Bellows!" cried Pencroft. "Well! these are lucky seals!"
It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of the ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the amphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their length did not exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the head.
As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus Harding and the reporter continued to explore the islet.
The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three hours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals' skins, which he intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any tanning process.
The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the channel they entered the Chimneys.
The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means of fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape. Cyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top's collar, and yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much intelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony's stock of tools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air into the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat--an indispensable condition to the success of the operation.
On the morning of the 20th of April began the "metallic period," as the reporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been said, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to his observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast spurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from their home. It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the Chimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a hut of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night and day.
This settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the bellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which they besides could renew on the way.
The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from southeast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to beat a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to Prospect Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to the species already discovered, were magnificent. Herbert found some new ones, among others some which Pencroft called "sham leeks"; for, in spite of their size, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive, shallot, or asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when cooked, are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable liquor is made. They therefore made a good store of the roots.
The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so allowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who took special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood, putting up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater. It was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the second because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated in a bird's beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns which served to hold the insects.
"And when it is in the pot," asked Pencroft naturally, "what will it be like?"
"An excellent piece of beef," replied Herbert.
"We will not ask more from it," replied the sailor,
During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did not offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would not meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood, the reporter thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower branches of a tree, an animal which he took for a bear, and which he very tranquilly began to draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in question did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades. It was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being about the size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color, the paws armed with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the leaves. Having identified the animal, which they did not disturb, Gideon Spilett erased "bear" from the title of his sketch, putting koala in its place, and the journey was resumed.
At five o'clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt. They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs which supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some hundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh water was within their reach.
The camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the forest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers, and pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological researches were put off till the next day. Supper was prepared, a good fire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o'clock, while one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild beasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly.
The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert, went to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already discovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the source of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs. This ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly suited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ; that is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in Corsica. In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the construction of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal, placed in alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus Harding intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to form, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he would direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding employed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world. Now that which had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which still yielded good results in countries which in ore and fuel, could not but succeed with the settlers in Lincoln Island.
The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the surface of the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces, and cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their surface. Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive layers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to carbonize. In this way, under the influence of the air projected by the blowing-machine, the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then into oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is to say, to rid it of the oxygen.
Thus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its extremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated in the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore. Using the mechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise, he threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the temperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce in time pure iron.
The operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the settlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump of iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle and fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied veinstone. These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did what, no doubt, he had to do.
A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge the second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but useful metal. At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th of April several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools, crowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb declared to be real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most serviceable state, that is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron and coal, which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from it the excess of coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which was wanting. The first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal, gives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation of the iron, gives steel of cementation.
It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed iron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered coal in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay suitable for the purpose.
He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold, with the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets, which, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an excellent temper.
Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured; blades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed into saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails, etc. At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths returned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take a fresh title.
第二天4月17日，水手第一句话是对吉丁•史佩莱说的。
“先生，”他问道，“今天我们干什么？”
“赛勒斯先生说干什么就干什么。”通讯记者答道。
在前一个时期，工程师的伙伴们不是制砖工人就是陶器工人，现在他们要变成冶金工人了。
昨天早饭以后，他们一直走到离“石窟”七英里的颚骨角，连绵不绝的沙丘到头了。那里的土壤看起来好象是火山土，没有象眺望岗那样的悬崖峭壁，只有一种火山喷发出来的奇形怪状的矿物质，在两个海角中间形成狭长海湾的边缘。居民们来到这里以后，就往回走了。暮色苍茫的时候，他们回到了“石窟”，可是他们想到能不能离开林肯岛的问题还没有肯定，就睡不着觉了。
海岛离帕摩图群岛一千二百英里，这是一段相当遥远的距离。一只小船是没法渡过去的，再说，已经快到寒冷的季节了。潘克洛夫特别强调这一点。即使有必要的工具，要造一只小船也很艰巨，何况移民们还没有工具，他们必须先开始做锤、斧、锛、锯、钻、刨等等，这需要一段相当长的时间。因此他们决定在林肯岛上过冬，并且要找一个比“石窟”舒服一些的地方避寒。
首先必须要找铁矿，工程师曾在海岛的西北部发现这种蕴藏，这种铁矿既适合炼钢，又适合炼铁。
一般的情况下，金属埋藏在地里的时候，质地并不纯粹。它们通常和氧或硫化合在一起。赛勒斯•史密斯上次带回来的两种标本就是这样，一种是没有碳化的磁铁矿，另一种是黄铁矿，也叫做硫化铁。因此，他们必须先用炭使氧化铁还原，也就是除去氧，然后才能得到纯粹的铁。这个还原过程是用炭把矿石烧到温度很高的时候进行的，可以用迅速而简便的土法（它的优点是只通过一道工序，就能把铁矿石炼成铁），也可以用鼓风炉——第一步使铁矿石熔化，然后排除和矿石化合在一起的百分之三至四的炭，使它变成铁。
现在，赛勒斯•史密斯需要铁，而且想尽早炼出来。他所捡到的铁矿石质地非常优良纯粹，是一种氧化铁。在捡来的时候，它是不规则的深灰色的大块，从中可以得到一种正八面结晶体形成的黑色碎末。天然的磁石里就含有这种矿石，瑞典和挪威大量出产这种原料，在那里把它炼成了欧洲最好的生铁。离这个矿脉不远就是煤层，居民们已经利用过这里的煤了。炼铁需要的原料就在附近，这就给工作带来极大的便利。英国的矿藏所以宝贵，就是因为从地下可以同时开采出煤和金属来进行冶炼的缘故。
“那么，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫说，“我们这就要炼铁了吗？”
“是的，朋友，”工程师答道，“为了这一点，我们首先要进行一样你所喜欢的工作——到小岛上去打海豹。”
“打海豹！”水手掉过脸来对吉丁•史佩莱说，“炼铁需要海豹吗？”
“既然赛勒斯这么说，那就不会错！”通讯记者答道。
工程师已经离开“石窟”了，别人又解答不了这个问题，潘克洛夫只好准备去打海豹。
赛勒斯•史密斯、赫伯特、吉丁•史佩莱、纳布和水手很快就在岸边集合，退潮的时候，这一带海峡形成一条浅滩可以通行，猎人们涉水过去，水深还不到膝盖。
史密斯还是第一次到小岛上来，他的伙伴们已经是第二次了。当初，气球就是把他们扔在这个地方的。
他们上岸的时候，有几百只企鹅望着他们，一点也不害怕。猎人们手里拿着棍子，本来很容易把它们打死，但这时候还不能无端杀害它们，因为海豹正躺在几锚链以外的沙滩上，不能把它们惊动了。还有一种鸟，样子很老实，它们的翅膀已经退化成短肢，象鳍似的往两边张开，浑身的羽毛和鳞片一样。居民们也没有侵犯它们。地面上到处是小洞，海鸟就在洞里做了窝。他们悄悄地穿过这一带往北走去。小岛尽头一带的水面上有许多黑色的大脑袋漂浮着，好象岩石在移动。
这就是他们打算猎捕的海豹，但是要想捉它们，首先必须等它们上岸，因为它们长着细密的短毛和纱锭似的躯体，在水里游起来非常快，想在海里捉住它是很困难的，在陆地上，由于它们的蹼足短小，它们只能摇摇摆摆地慢步走动。
潘克洛夫知道这种动物的习性，他教大家等着，海豹会到沙滩上来晒太阳的，而且一会儿就会躺下睡熟。那时候再切断它们的归路，打它们的头部。
猎人们躲在岩石后面，静静地等待着。
一个钟头以后，海豹到沙滩上来玩耍了。上来的有半打。潘克洛夫和赫伯特绕过小岛的海角，切断它们的后路，从后面向它们进攻。这时候赛勒斯•史密斯、史佩莱和纳布也从石头后边爬了出来，向即将成为战场的地方溜去。
水手高大的身材忽然站起来了。他大吼一声。工程师和他的两个伙伴马上跑过去站在大海和海豹之间。一会儿工夫，就有两只海豹死在地上了。可是其他的几只却平平安安地逃回了大海。
“史密斯先生，你不是要海豹吗，现在打到了！”水手一面说，一面向工程师走去。
“好极了，”史密斯答道。“我们要拿它们做风箱！”
“风箱！”潘克洛夫喊道，“怎么！这些海豹的命运倒不错呀！”
原来工程师打算用这种两栖动物的皮来做冶炼时不可缺少的鼓风机。这两个海豹大小普通，身长不满六英尺。它们的头部和狗的脑袋很象。
如果把两只海豹抬回去，既费力，又没有用，因此纳布和潘克洛夫决定就在这里剥它们的皮，赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者利用这个时间巡视小岛去了。
水手和黑人剥得非常巧妙，三个钟头以后，赛勒斯•史密斯就得到了两整张海豹皮，他打算不加鞣制，就这样使用。
等到潮水再度下退的时候，居民们就涉过海峡，回“石窟”来了。
然后，他们就把海豹皮绷在木架上，用纤维把它缝起来，尽量使它不漏气。赛勒斯•史密斯除了用托普的套环做成两片钢刀以外，其他什么工具也没有。然而他非常有办法，发挥了伙伴们无穷的智慧，三天以后，小队的工具就又增添了一件鼓风机了，在矿石加热的时候，用这个工具往矿石里送风——这是争取胜利完成冶炼工作的一个不可缺少的条件。
4月20日清晨，正如通讯记者所记载的，“金属时代”开始了。前面已经说过，工程师决定在邻近煤矿和铁矿的地方进行操作。根据他的观察，矿脉在富兰克林山东北支脉的山麓。这地方离“石窟”六英里，每天往返回家是不可能的。因此，小队一致决定用树枝搭一个棚子过夜，这样，他们就可以昼夜不停地进行这项重要的工作了。
早晨，这个问题决定以后，他们就出发了。纳布和潘克洛夫找了一个筐子，把风箱放在上面拖着走，另外还在筐上放了大量的蔬菜和兽肉，除了所带的以外，他们还准备沿途补充一些。
途中要经过啄木鸟林，他们从东南进入丛林，经过树木最密的地方，往西北方斜穿出去。他们必须开辟一条道路，将来这条道路可以把眺望岗和富兰克林山直接联系起来。有许多非常美丽的植物，它们的品种都是大家熟悉的。赫伯特又发现一些新的品种，其中有的潘克洛夫把它们叫做“假韭菜”；因为虽然比韭菜大得多，却也和洋葱、日本葱、冬葱和芦笋一样，属于百合科。这些植物长有木质的根，烧出来非常好吃。这些根经过发酵以后，还可以制成一种非常可口的饮料。因此他们大量地采集了这种树根。
他们在森林里走了很长的一段路，整整走了一天，因此有充分的时间观察林中的动植物。托普专门搜寻兽类，它在草木之间穿进穿出，把各种动物全赶出来了。赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱用弓箭射死两只袋鼠，还射死一只既很象刺猬，又很象食蚁兽的动物。从它缩成一团、满身刺针倒竖的样子看来好象刺猬，它长着利爪，嘴部又细又长，末端跟鸟嘴一样，这又很象食蚁兽；另外它还有一根伸缩灵活的舌头，舌头上有很多小刺，可以用来捕食昆虫。
“等它下了锅以后，”潘克洛夫照例这样问道，“它象什么？”
“象最好的牛肉。”赫伯特答道。
“好，我们也不能要求过高了。”水手说。
在旅途中，他们看见几次野猪，可是这些野猪并没有向小队冲来，看来他们好象不会遇见什么猛兽了，可是这时候通讯记者隐约看见在几步以外浓密的树丛中，有一只野兽伏在一棵树的低枝间。他以为那是一只熊，就开始非常镇定地把它画下来。幸而这只动物并不属于可怕的蹠行类，它只是一只无尾熊，一般称为“懒兽”，体形和较大的狗差不多，身上的毛既硬又显得脏，脚上生着有力的爪子，能够攀登树木，它平时吃树叶。他们认清了这个动物，也没有侵犯它。吉丁•史佩莱把写生画的标题“熊”擦去，改成“无尾熊”，然后大家就继续前进了。
傍晚五点钟，赛勒斯•史密斯下令大家停下来。他们现在已经穿过森林，来到作为富兰克林山东部基础的主要支脉下。红河在几百英尺以外的地方流过，附近可以得到大量的淡水。
营地马上就安排好了。不到一个小时，他们就在森林边缘的树木之间，用爬藤把树枝编起来，搭成一个营棚，外面抹上一层泥土，这样就建成一个不坏的住处了。他们的地质勘探工作预定到第二天再进行。现在营棚前生起了一堆熊熊的篝火，烤肉在火焰上转动着。晚饭准备好了，八点钟的时候，大家都已睡下，只留一个人守夜，不使篝火熄灭，以防野兽潜到营地附近来。
第二天，4月21日，赛勒斯•史密斯让赫伯特随同一道去找古代生成的土层，上一次他已经在这种土地上发现了铁矿石的标本。他们在东北的一个支脉下发现矿脉，这个地方靠近红河发源地，而且矿石就露在地面上。这种矿石容易熔化，含铁量也很大，非常适合工程师打算采用的还原炼铁法，也就是加泰罗尼亚人用的土法，不过象科西嘉人那样把这种方法简化了。一般所说的土法，需要砌个熔炉，制造几个坩埚，把矿石和炭一层夹一层地放在坩埚里，然后让它变化和还原。可是赛勒斯•史密斯不打算用这些设备，只想把矿石和煤做成一个立方体，用风箱把空气鼓入立方体的中心。毫无疑问，这是土八•该隐以及世界上最早的冶金学家所采用的办法。既然亚当的子孙用这个方法能够成功，而且在铁矿和燃料丰富的国家里也曾收到良好的效果，那么林肯岛上的居民也一定会成功的。
他们在地上毫不费力地捡到炭和铁矿石。他们先把铁矿石打碎，用手把铁矿石表面一层杂质擦干净，然后就把炭和铁矿石一层夹一层地堆起来，好象木炭工人用木柴烧炭那样。这样，在鼓风机的作用下，炭就变为碳酸，然后又变成氧化碳，在变成氧化碳的过程中就使氧化铁还原，放出了氧气。
工程师就这样进行工作。他事先在窑里造了一根陶土的管子，把它装在海豹皮风箱的一端，然后把风箱装在矿石堆附近，工程师用一个木架、一些植物纤维做的绳子和一个秤锤做成鼓风机，把大量的空气吹到立方体里去，温度提高以后，空气也促进化学变化，到一定的时候就能冶炼出纯铁来。
工作是艰巨的，需要居民们最大的耐心和全部的智慧。最后终于成功了，炼出一块和海绵差不多的生铁，这块生铁还要加以锤炼，也就是说，必须经过打铁，把熔解的杂质排除出去。当然，这些业余铁匠是没有锤子的，可是他们的情况并不见得比最早的冶金家更坏，因此他们就模仿前辈的样子干起来了。
他们给一块生铁按上木柄，当作锤子，把花岗石当作砧子，就这样打起铁来。他们打出来的铁，虽然粗糙一些，却很有用。经过无数次的艰苦尝试，终于在4月25日打出了几根铁条，用它们做成许多工具，如铁橇、钳子、鹤嘴锄、铲子等等。潘克洛夫和纳布拿着这些工具，兴奋得象得了宝贝似的。
可是这种金属还没有达到尽善尽美的程度，也就是说还没有变成钢。钢是铁和炭的混合物。要取得钢，必须从生铁里除去多余的炭，或是把一定数量的炭加到熟铁里去才行。第一种脱炭的方法可以产生天然钢或是铸钢，第二种加炭的方法可以制成有泡钢。
赛勒斯•史密斯打算炼制后面一种，因为他炼得的铁质地很纯。为了进行这项工作，他事先用陶土做了一个坩埚，把铁和炭末一起放在坩埚里加热，结果钢就炼成了。
这种钢不论在冷或热的情况下，都能任人摆布，于是他就用锤子在钢上进行加工。纳布和潘克洛夫在他精明指导下，把钢烧红了，然后突然浸入水中，制得了许多硬度很强的斧头。
还有许多其他工具也制造出来了，形状自然是非常简陋的，其中有：做刨刀、砍柴斧、短斧用的钢板，做锯和凿子用的钢块；此外还有制造铲子、鹤嘴锄、锤子、钉子用的铁等等。5月5日那天，“金属时期”终于结束了。铁匠们回到“石窟”里，很快就要有新的工作给他们加上新的头衔了。
Book 1 Chapter 16
It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for some days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter. However, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was advisable to provide against it.
In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably terrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.
Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he had discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances which are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar accident.
"Besides," added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things with his companions, "we have some precautions to take."
"Why? The island is not inhabited," said the reporter.
"That is probable," replied the engineer, "although we have not yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night, or to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay pirates--"
"What!" said Herbert, "at such a distance from land?"
"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer. "These pirates are bold sailors as well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly."
"Well," replied Pencroft, "we will fortify ourselves against savages with two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will it not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking anything else?"
"That would be best," added Gideon Spilett.
"Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns which we have searched for in vain here?"
"That is true," replied the engineer, "but you forget, my friends, that it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not see towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we are placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not exposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest."
"Then, captain," replied the sailor, "let us build a house on the edge of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to be masons!"
"Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider the matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work, and would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against enemies from the interior as those from outside."
"That is true, Cyrus," replied the reporter, "but we have already examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a cranny!"
"No, not one!" added Pencroft. "Ah, if we were able to dig out a dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach of harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks seaward, five or six rooms--"
"With windows to light them!" said Herbert, laughing.
"And a staircase to climb up to them!" added Neb.
"You are laughing," cried the sailor, "and why? What is there impossible in what I propose? Haven't we got pickaxes and spades? Won't Captain Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn't it true, captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?"
Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his fanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them at their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north.
They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme care, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare, straight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons which fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the very top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.
It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it was not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the shore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to say, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.
The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the shore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed a sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound together by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only forty-five degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were also carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend far, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes, reached to the beach.
Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake must overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red Creek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had not yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored, that is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect Heights.
The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern and eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.
The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted on the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black against the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant cockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one bough to another.
The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake, made a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth of the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a half. Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable space between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point, and vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of the Creek and the Mercy.
Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great care. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only weapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that these animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the settlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb killed it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile, and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible that others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes, furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great rapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called him back directly.
The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake, was soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the point which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Harding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was considerable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the escape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could be discovered, would be of great use.
The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other, began to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water appeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some fishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.
The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed that the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the lake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of this were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank, which, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.
On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and there, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was viewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the surface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with arrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top rushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color, short beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It was a "coot," the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds and that of palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from pleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters, and it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper.
The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they would not be long in reaching the part which they already knew. The engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the discharge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he could not conceal his astonishment.
At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of agitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if he was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and was suddenly silent.
Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention to Top's behavior; but the dog's barking soon became so frequent that the engineer noticed it.
"What is there, Top?" he asked.
The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then rushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the lake.
"Here, Top!" cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture into the treacherous water.
"What's happening down there?" asked Pencroft, examining the surface of the lake.
"Top smells some amphibious creature," replied Herbert.
"An alligator, perhaps," said the reporter.
"I do not think so," replied Harding. "Alligators are only met with in regions less elevated in latitude."
Meanwhile Top had returned at his master's call, and had regained the shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass, and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared. There was some mystery there.
The engineer was puzzled.
"Let us pursue this exploration to the end," said he.
Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able to discover how and where the waters were discharged. "There is no doubt this overflow exists," he repeated, and since it is not visible it must go through the granite cliff at the west!"
"But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Considerable importance," replied the engineer; "for if it flows through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy to render habitable after turning away the water."
"But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the bottom of the lake," said Herbert, "and that it reaches the sea by some subterranean passage?"
"That might be," replied the engineer, "and should it be so we shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for us."
The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury, and before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time into the lake.
All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off, and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the water, which did not appear to be deep in that place.
Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches, belonged.
"A lamantin!" he cried.
It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of cetaceans, which bear the name of the "dugong," for its nostrils were open at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water.
Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top's help, and attack the dangerous animal in its own element.
"No, Neb," said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.
Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the lake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.
Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on. Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last long. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on a little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it. The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp blade.
What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible blow had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much interested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the Chimneys.
5月6日，这一天相当于北半球地区的11月6日。一连好几天天气都是阴沉沉的，现在必须准备过冬了。可是目前的气温还不大低，如果林肯岛上有一只摄氏寒暑表量一下的话，平均温度一定还保持在零上10度到12度左右。这并不奇怪，因为林肯岛大致在南纬35度与40度之间，它的气候正和北半球的西西里岛和希腊一样。可是希腊和西西里岛也有严寒和冰雪，因此在冬季最冷的时候，林肯岛上一定也会封冻的，最好还是预先准备。
总之，即使还没有严寒的威胁，然而雨季也快来了。这座荒凉的海岛孤零零地处在大洋中，任凭风霜雨雪的侵袭，这里经常变天，往往成为严重的灾害。因此，寻找一个比“石窟”舒适的住所的问题，就必须认真考虑而且必须立刻解决了。
自然，潘克洛夫对自己找到的这个住所是有些偏爱的，可是他也知道必须另外找一个地方。海水已经到“石窟”里来过一次了，当时的情祝大家都清楚。如果再遇到一次类似的事件，那就不可收拾了。
“并且，”赛勒斯•史密斯当天和伙伴们谈到这些问题的时候补充道，“我们还要有一些防御设备。”
“为什么？岛上又没有人。”通讯记者说。
“我们还没有察看过内陆，”工程师说，“也可能没有人，不过，即使没有人，我想猛兽恐怕是不会少的。我们必须对于可能遭到的进攻有防备，这样就不需要每晚守夜或是生火了。另外，朋友们，我们对每一件事都必须有远见。我们所在的地方，是太平洋上海盗经常出没的地方……”
“什么！”赫伯特说，“离陆地这么远他们还会来？”
“是的，孩子，”工程师说。“海盗是勇敢的水手，同时也是可怕的敌人，我们必须采取适当的措施。”
“好，”潘克洛夫说，“不管是两条腿的野人还是四条腿的野兽，我们都得提防，可是，史密斯先生，我们先把海岛搜查一下，然后再决定行动不更好吗？”
“再好也没有了。”吉丁•史佩莱加了一句。
“我们在这里找来找去也找不到一个山洞，也许山那边有，谁知道呢？”
“对，”工程师答道，“可是你们忘了，朋友们，我们必须住在靠水的地方。根据在富兰克林山顶上所看到的情况，西边既没有小溪，又没有河流。相反的，我们这里却在慈悲河与格兰特湖之间，这个优越条件是不能忽略的。还有，南半球的贸易风是从西北吹来的，这里向着东方，不象其他的地方迎着风。”
“那么，”水手说，“我们就在湖边造一所房子吧。现在砖头和工具都有了。我们制砖工人、陶器工人、冶金工人和铁工的工作都做得了，瓦工的工作一定更能做得了！”
“是的，朋友。可是我们无论作什么决定，都必须经过全面的考虑。如果我们能找到一个天然的住宅，就可以省掉很多工作，而且也比较安全，因为天然的住宅既可以防御本岛的敌人，又可以防御外来的敌人。”
“对，赛勒斯，”通讯记者说，“可是整个的花岗石壁我们都检查过了，连一个窟窿，一条裂缝都没有！”
“的确，什么也没有！”潘克洛夫补充道。“唉，要是我们能在峭壁的高处，什么危险也达不到的地方凿一个住所，那就好了！面临大海，有五六间房……”
“房里还有窗户透亮！”赫伯特笑着说。
“还有楼梯可以上上下下！”纳布补充道。
“这有什么可笑的？”水手大声说，“难道我提议的就办不到吗？我们不是已经有鹤嘴锄和铲子了吗？史密斯先生难道不能给我们做火药炸山洞吗？史密斯先生，只要我们什么时候需要火药，你马上就可以做好，是不是？”
潘克洛夫在兴致勃勃地发挥他的幻想，赛勒斯•史密斯静听着。要想把花岗石炸开，即使有炸药也是十分困难的，如果自然界不能帮助他们解决住的问题，这的确是一件麻烦的事。工程师没有回答水手的问题，只是建议再从河口到北部峭壁尽头的拐角处去仔细检查一遍。
于是大家都出去了，在将近两英里的一段距离内，作了一次非常仔细的检查，可是峭壁光滑而陡峭，找不到一个洞穴。许多野鸽在峭壁的上空盘旋，它们的窝在峰顶上，实际是参差不齐的花岗石边缘上的一些小孔。
这种情况使人非常为难，不管用鹤嘴锄还是炸药，要打算在这个峭壁上开出一个能够住人的山洞来，都是妄想。因此，目前的情况是：一方面他们必须放弃原来潘克洛夫所找到的“石窟”；可是另一方面，除了“石窟”以外，这一带海岸上再也没有其他可以藏身的地方。
搜索完毕了，移民们已经来到峭壁的北边拐角，峭壁到这里就是终点，再过去经过一段很长的距离往下倾斜，平伏在海岸上。从这里直到西边的尽头，只剩下一层厚厚的岩石、泥土和沙粒所形成的斜坡，上面点缀着一些草木，它的倾斜度只有45度。斜坡上的树木是一丛丛地长在一起的，此外还铺着很厚的野草。可是过去不远，就没有植物，成为一片铺展得很开阔的沙地平原了，这片平原从斜坡的尽头开始，一直延伸到海滨。
赛勒斯•史密斯认为漫出来的湖水一定会流到这边来，他的想法并不是毫无根据。红河流过那么多的水来，当然要通过河流或其他水道才能输出。但是在已经探索过的岸上，也就是说，从眺望岗以西的河口起，工程师始终没有找到这个出口。
工程师现在向伙伴们建议爬上斜坡，从眺望岗回“石窟”去，这样就可以探索湖的东岸和北岸了。大家都一致同意，几分钟以后，赫伯特和纳布就爬上了高地。赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫也沉着地跟了上去。
太阳照耀在美丽的湖面上，闪光透过树木射出来。这是海岛上景色特别优美的地方。他们贪看着成群的树木。权丫的老树在一片绿茵上显得格外黝黑。光艳夺目的美冠鹦鹉在枝头尖叫着，象转动着的万花筒似的，在树木之间往来跳跃。
居民们没有直接走向湖的北岸，他们绕过高地的边缘，从左边往河口走去。这一段弯弯曲曲的道路有一英里半以上。不过树木稀疏，间隔很宽，走起来并不困难。肥沃的土地到这儿显然就终止了，红河与慈悲河之间一带的草木大概是不会这么茂盛的。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们小心翼翼地在这片新土地上走着。他们的武器只有弓箭和带有铁尖的棍子。幸亏没有什么野兽出现，大概它们经常在南部密林出没，可是居民们突然看见托普站在一条蟒蛇的面前，不禁吃了一惊。这条蛇长达十四英尺到十五英尺，纳布一棍把它打死了。赛勒斯•史密斯仔细看了一下，然后告诉大家这条蛇并没有毒，它是衲脊蛇，新南威尔士的土人常常饲养这种蛇。可是这里也可能有其他能使人致命的毒蛇，例如叉尾的蝰蛇——它们常常从脚底下竖起来；或是飞蛇——它们生着一对耳朵，爬得非常快。托普刚受了一次惊吓，又开始追捕另一只爬虫去了，它跑得非常急促，大家都替它捏一把汗。它的主人马上就把它喊了回来。
他们很快就来到红河注入格兰特湖的地方。探险家们还记得，对岸就是他们从富兰克林山下来以后到过的地方。赛勒斯•史密斯认为流到湖里去的水量是相当可观的。因此大自然一定要给过多的湖水找一个出口。而且无疑会形成一个瀑布，如果能够找到它，是有很大用处的。
移民们拉开距离往前走，但是彼此间并不失去联系。他们绕着湖岸走，湖里的水很深，看起来到处都是游鱼。潘克洛夫决定做几根钓杆，想法子钓几条上来。
他们首先绕过东北角。湖水也许就是从这里流出去拘，因为湖岸几乎和高地的边缘一样高。然而还是找不到任何排水的痕迹。移民们继续沿岸搜索，拐了一个小弯以后，湖岸低落下来，和海岸保持平行。
岸这边的森林比较稀疏，可是东一丛西一簇的树木却使周围的风景更加美妙，从这里可以看到格兰特湖的全景，水面上没有一丝波纹。托普在灌木丛里搜寻着，赶出一大群各式各样的飞鸟。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特向它们敬了几箭，有一只被少年射中了，掉在草地上。托普跑过去，衔了一只美丽的水鸟回来。它浑身青灰色，嘴很短，前额非常发达，脚爪有蹼连着，好象花边一样，翅膀的周围镶着一道白线。这是一只“黑鸭”，大小和较大的鹧鸪差不多，是一种长趾类的水禽，介于涉水鸟和蹼足鸟之间。这种鸟的味道实在不值得一提，比雉差得很远。可是托普并不象它的主人们那样挑剔，因此大家决定把“黑鸭”留给它当晚饭。
居民们现在沿着湖的东岸前进，不久就要到上次来过的地方了。工程师找不到湖水流出去的迹象，感到非常诧异。他在跟通讯记者和水手说话的时候，也隐藏不住内心的惊讶。
托普一直保持着安静；这时候忽然显得急躁起来。这个机灵的畜生在岸边来回奔跑，突然停下来看着湖面。它举起一只爪子，好象指着什么看不见的动物似的，然后狂吠几声，又突然安静下来了。
起初，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们都没有注意托普的行动；可是它愈叫愈厉害，这才引起工程师的注意。
“托普怎么了？”他问道。
托普向它的主人跳过来，显得非常不安，接着又往岸边冲去。突然，它跳到湖里去了。
“回来，托普！”赛勒斯•史密斯喊道，他怕狗到水里去会遇到危险。
“那里发生什么事了？”潘克洛夫望着湖面问道。
“托普闻到什么两栖动物了吧。”赫伯特回答说。
“也许是一只鳄鱼。”通讯记者说。
“我想不是的，”史密斯答道。“只有纬度较低的地方才有鳄鱼。”
这时候托普被它的主人喊住，又跑到岸上来了。但是它没法安静下来，它伏在深草丛中，受直觉的支配，两只眼睛好象紧盯着什么看不见的动物在水面下移动。这时湖上很平静，水面一点涟漪也没有。居民们几次停在岸边，注视着湖水，但是什么也看不见。水里不知暗藏着什么哑谜。
工程师也莫名其妙。
“我们把探测进行到底吧。”他说。
半个钟头以后，他们齐集在眺望岗上湖的东南角。到这里为止，湖岸算是搜查遍了，但是工程师还是没有发现湖水是从哪里流出去的。“这个出口肯定是存在的，”他重复道，“既然看不见，那么湖水一定是从西边的花岗石壁里流出去的！”
“你知道它从哪里流出去有什么用处呢，亲爱的赛勒斯？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“相当重要，”工程师说；“假如水是从峭壁里流出去的，那么峭壁里很可能有洞，只要把洞里的水排出去，就可以住人。”
“可是，史密斯先生，”赫伯特问道，“难道湖水不可能从湖底流出去，经过地道通入大海吗？”
“这也可能，”工程师说，“真要是那样，那是大自然没有给我们准备住的地方，我们就只好自己盖房子了。”
移民们正打算穿过高地回到“石窟”去，托普又表现得急躁起来。它愤怒地叫着，它的主人还没有来得及阻止，它又跳到水里去了。
大家齐往岸边跑去。托普已经游到二十英尺以外去了。赛勒斯正在喊它，水里突然钻出一个大脑袋来，那里的水看起来并不深。
这是一只两栖动物，它有着圆锥形的脑袋，一双大眼睛，嘴边长着柔软的长须。赫伯特一看就知道它的种类了。
“海牛！”他喊道。
这并不是海牛，而是鲸类的一种，叫做儒艮，它的鼻孔生在鼻子的上部。这只巨大的动物向托普扑过来，托普想往岸上逃。这时它的主人没法援救它，吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特匆忙之中也没有想起弯弓搭箭。儒艮抓住托普，把它拖到水底下去了。
纳布手里拿着铁头的标枪，打算到那可怕的动物的活动区域去向它进攻，救出托普。
“不行，纳布。”工程师拦住了勇敢的仆人。
这时候水底展开了一场搏斗，这是一场不可思议的斗争。以托普所处的环境来说，它简直没法招架；水面上白浪翻腾，这场搏斗一定是非常可怕的，看来托普非死在这里不可了！然而，托普突然又从另一个漩涡里钻了出来。不知哪里来的一股力量把它一下子抛离水面十英尺，然后又掉在动荡的湖水里，不久以后，它就游上岸来了。奇怪的是它身上居然没有重伤，轻易地脱了险。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们都不明白这是怎么一回事。同样令人惊异的是：水里似乎还在继续搏斗。大概儒艮遭到什么猛兽的进攻，因此才放下托普进行自卫。搏斗并没有继续很久。湖水被鲜血染红了，儒艮从周围一片猩红色的湖水中浮了上来，很快就在湖南角的一小片沙滩上搁浅了。移民们向它跑去。儒艮已经死了。这是一只巨大的动物，长达十五到十六英尺，至少有三千到四千磅重。它的颈部有一处伤口，好象是尖刀割破的。
究竟是什么两栖动物进行了骇人的袭击，把凶猛的儒艮咬死的呢？谁也说不上来，史密斯和他的伙伴们对这件事情怀着莫大的兴趣，回“石窟”去了。
Book 1 Chapter 17
The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to prepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft ascended by the river, to renew their store of wood.
The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the dugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass of flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to keep the fat for the use of the colony. As to the animal's flesh it would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of the native princes. But that was Neb's affair.
At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested in the incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery of that submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given the dugong so strange a wound. He remained at the edge of the lake, looking, observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters, which sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun.
At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was tolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped gradually, and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the center. The lake might be considered as a large center basin, which was filled by the water from the Red Creek.
"Well, Cyrus," said the reporter, "there seems to be nothing suspicious in this water."
"No, my dear Spilett," replied the engineer, "and I really do not know how to account for the incident of yesterday."
"I acknowledge," returned Spilett, "that the wound given this creature is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was so vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a powerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed the dugong!"
"Yes," replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; "there is something there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself--how I was drawn from the waves, and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I feel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall discover some day. Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular incidents before our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves, and continue our work."
It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to discover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must exist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place. By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the southern angle. He followed the current, and arrived at the south point of the lake.
There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly lost in some fissure in the ground.
Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.
"There," said he, rising, "is the discharge of the water; there, doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through cavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!"
The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging it into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large hole one foot only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the opening so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was such that the branch was torn from the engineer's hands and disappeared.
"There is no doubt about it now," repeated Harding. "There is the outlet, and I will lay it open to view!"
"How?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet." "And how will you lower the level?"
"By opening another outlet larger than this."
"At what place, Cyrus?"
"At the part of the bank nearest the coast."
"But it is a mass of granite!" observed Spilett.
"Well," replied Cyrus Harding, "I will blow up the granite, and the water escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening--"
"And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach," added the reporter.
"A fall that we shall make use of!" replied Cyrus. "Come, come!"
The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was such that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how was this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect instruments? Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above their strength?
When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert and Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.
"The woodmen have just finished, captain." said the sailor, laughing, "and when you want masons--"
"Masons,--no, but chemists," replied the engineer.
"Yes," added the reporter, "we are going to blow up the island--"
"Blow up the island?" cried Pencroft.
"Part of it, at least," replied Spilett.
"Listen to me, my friends," said the engineer. And he made known to them the result of his observations.
According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in the mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended to penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through which the water rushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger outlet. Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore. This was what Harding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at his disposal.
It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft, received this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a cascade, that suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist as a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would be all that they liked, "even a professor of dancing and deportment," said he to Neb, if that was ever necessary.
Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the dugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect confidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly, without even asking a question. A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein of coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the most recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a specimen. All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these stones to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.
The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations. These shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint, alumina, and sulphuret of iron--the latter in excess--it was necessary to separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as rapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could then be extracted.
This was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents the most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a nation can be measured by the consumption which is made of it. This acid would later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of candles, tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for another use.
Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground was perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites, buttressed one against the other, the whole being covered with a thin layer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a nut.
This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the shist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap, the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several air-holes being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal.
They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina, two equally soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being so.
While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with other operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,--it was eagerness.
Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it in large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine from the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to be treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one or other of these substances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by separating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the engineer wished to obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment by lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless, while treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap, which could be put to domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather try to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for marine plants abounded on the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form wrack. A large quantity of these plants was collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the open air. The combustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the result was a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of "natural soda."
This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.
But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.
Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of the vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would have been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it up. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had nothing to do but purify this salt.
These different works lasted a week. They were finished before the transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been accomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained. All this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the chemical transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever workmen. Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best.
When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result of the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina, flint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water. They stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained a clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble. Lastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of iron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the sulphate of alumina, was thrown away.
Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable works are necessary--a special set of tools, an apparatus of platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the transformation is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these at his disposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured by very simple means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior degree of concentration. It is thus that the acid known under the name of Nordhausen acid is made.
To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make, to calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation, would produce the acid.
The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would distil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer was the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many different ways.
Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid; and that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives azotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.
But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed.
However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a last operation he would procure the substance which had given so much trouble.
Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints of an oily yellow mixture.
This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at a distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion, and when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented himself with saying,--
"Here is nitro-glycerine!"
It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so many accidents. However, since a way has been found to transform it into dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or sugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used with some security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the settlers worked on Lincoln Island.
"And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?" said Pencroft incredulously.
"Yes, my friend," replied the engineer, "and this nitro-glycerine will produce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and will oppose a greater resistance to the explosion."
"And when shall we see this, captain?"
"To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the engineer."
The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point which formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred feet from the coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from the waters, which were only restrained by their granite case. Therefore, if this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form a stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau, would rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the lake would be greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be exposed, which was their final aim.
Under the engineer's directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was made on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a much lower level than that of the water of the lake. In this way the explosive force, by scattering the rock, would open a large place for the water to rush out.
The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great effect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine to the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that towards four o'clock in the evening, the mine was finished.
Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised. Generally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in bursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce the explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without exploding.
Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In default of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to guncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This substance, pressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would burst by means of a fuse, and cause the explosion.
But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock. He resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not succeed.
In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the operator could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim to the operation. Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of iron, weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just above the mine. Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur, was attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay on the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being set on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching fire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the nitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after having sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the nitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few drops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was already suspended.
This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the place, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.
The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact, five and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was heard. The island appeared to tremble to its very foundation. Stones were projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano. The shock produced by the displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the Chimneys shook. The settlers, although they were more than two miles from the mine, were thrown on the ground.
They rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank of the lake must have been shattered by the explosion.
A cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid stream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a height of three hundred feet on to the beach!
第二天，5月7日，史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱爬上了眺望岗，赫伯特和潘克洛夫出发到河的上游去，打算补充些木柴，留下纳布一个人在家里准备早饭。
工程师和通讯记者很快来到了儒艮搁浅的小沙滩，这块沙滩就在湖的南头。一大群飞鸟已经在啄它的肉了，赛勒斯打算把肉留给小队里吃，于是用石头把鸟赶走。这种动物的肉是上好的食物，在马来群岛和其他某些地方，是当地王孙的特菜。不过这还要纳布动手来做。
这时候赛勒斯•史密斯又产生了新的念头。他对昨天发生的事情感到极大的兴趣。他打算揭穿那场水底战斗的秘密，证实一下究竟是什么怪兽使儒艮受到这么奇怪的创伤。他在湖边站了很久，看了又看，可是什么也没有，只是晨曦乍起，照耀得平静的湖水闪闪发光。
靠近儒艮搁浅的沙滩一带，湖水比较浅，可是从这里开始，湖底就逐渐倾斜下去，估计湖的中央可能相当深。整个湖好比是一个巨大的中央盆地，红河的流水把它灌满了。
“赛勒斯，”通讯记者说，“水底好象并没有什么可疑的东西。”
“的确，亲爱的史佩莱，”工程师答道，“我真不知道该怎么解释昨天的事情。”
“我承认，”史佩莱说，“至少儒艮所受的伤是很奇怪的。还有一点我也不明白，托普怎么会被猛烈地扔到水面上来的呢？不知道的人一定以为有一只强大的胳膊把它扔起来，然后又用刺刀把儒艮杀死！”
“是的，”工程师说，这时候他陷入了沉思，“有些事情我真不懂。可是另外一个问题你是不是比较明白一些呢，亲爱的史佩莱。我究竟是怎么得救的——怎么从海浪里被拖出来，带到沙丘上去的？是啊！难道这不是问题吗？现在我敢肯定，这里头准有什么秘密，这个秘密将来毫无疑问是可以揭穿的。我们不妨留心观察，但是不必在大家面前讨论这些怪事，我们先把这些话藏在心里，继续我们的工作。”
大家总记得，工程师到目前为止，还没有发现多余湖水外泄的地方，但是他知道一定有这么一个地方。他在这里看见一股急流，感到非常奇怪。他扔了几块木头到水里去，发现它流向南边的拐角。他跟着水流，到达了湖的南端。
这里湖水下陷了一块，好象有一部分水漏进了地缝似的。
史密斯把耳朵贴在和湖面一样高的地面上，静静地倾听着，他清晰地听到地下瀑布的响声。
“排水的地方有了。”他一面说，一面站起身来，“没有问题，湖水经过花岗右壁里的一条甬道，一直流向大海，我们可以利用它所流经的石洞。瞧吧，我能够找到它！”
工程师砍了一根很长的树枝，除去树叶，把它放在夹岸的拐角处。他发现水面以下只有一英尺的地方，有一个大窟窿。这就是他们很久以来一直没有找到的排水口，水流的力量非常大，连工程师手里的树枝也被冲得无影无踪了。
“现在没有疑问了，”史密斯重复道。“出口就在这里，我要把它打开来看看！”
“你打算怎么办？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“把湖面降低三英尺。”
“你怎么降低湖面呢？”
“开一个比这个更大的出口。”
“开在哪儿，赛勒斯？”
“开在离海滨最近的地方。”
“可是那是一片花岗石呀！”史佩莱说。
“嗯，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我要把花岗石炸开，水流出去以后，湖面就低了，那时候就会露出洞口来……”
“可以开辟一个瀑布，把水泻在海滩上。”通讯记者补充道。
“开辟一个我们可以利用的瀑布！”赛勒斯说。“来吧，来吧！”
工程师催着他的伙伴走了，通讯记者完全相信史密斯，他毫不怀疑这项事业会不成功。但是，没有火药，工具又不齐全，究竟怎样才能把花岗石壁炸开呢？工程师对这个工作虽然很热心，可是他们的能力不是达不到吗？
当史密斯和通讯记者回到“石窟”的时候，赫伯特和潘克洛夫正从木筏上往下卸木柴。
“樵夫的工作才做完，史密斯先生，”水手笑道，“你要泥水匠的时候……”
“泥水匠，……不要，现在要化学家。”工程师答道。
“对了，”通讯记者接着说，“我们要炸海岛……”
“炸海岛？”潘克洛夫大声说。
“至少要炸一部分。”史佩莱答道。
“听我说，朋友们。”工程师说。接着他向大家宣布了视察的结果。
根据工程师的说法，不管是大是小，在眺望岗下面的花岗石壁里，一定有一个山洞。他打算要穿开石壁到里面去。为了这个目的，首先就必须凿开一个较大的出口，使湖面降低，然后清除急流通过的山洞。因此要制造一种炸药，在岸上的其他部位炸开一条深沟。这就是史密斯打算利用自然界供给他的矿物的计划。
不用说，大家一致热烈拥护这个计划，特别是潘克洛夫。进行大规模的工作、炸花岗石、人工制造瀑布，这些事都合乎水手的胃口。既然工程师需要化学药品，他就象过去变成泥水匠和皮匠似的，一下子又变成化学家了。大家需要什么，他就可以干什么，正如他对纳布所说的，如果必要的话，“连舞蹈和礼仪教师都能担任”。
纳布和潘克洛夫首先被派去取儒艮的油，把它的肉留着食用。他们对工程师十分信任，连一句话也不问，马上就出发了。几分钟以后，赛勒斯•史密斯、赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱也带着筐子往煤层去了，那里的最近过渡地层里，含有大量的黄铁矿石，史密斯上一次曾经找到过一块这类的标本。他们用了一整天的工夫，把矿石运回“石窟”，傍晚的时候，这些矿石已经运来好几吨了。
第二天，5月8日，工程师开始工作了。这些黄铁矿石的主要成分是炭、火石、矾土和硫化铁，其中硫化铁的含量过多，必须使它分离，尽快地把它变为硫酸盐。取得硫酸盐以后，就可以蒸馏出硫酸来了。
他们的目的就是要取得硫酸。硫酸是一种不可缺少的原料，根据硫酸的消耗量，就可以估计出一个国家工业生产的情况来。这种酸的用处很大，居民们将来可以利用它制造蜡烛，鞣制皮革等等，可是这一次工程师另有用途，把它留起来了。
赛勒斯•史密斯在“石窟”后面找了一块十分平坦的地方，他在地面上铺了一层树枝和木柴，上面堆了几块黄铁矿石，互相架起来，上面又盖了一层薄薄的黄铁矿石，这是事先打碎的，大小都和核桃差不多。
这一步完成以后，他们就把木柴点着了，热度传到片岩上，片岩含有炭和硫磺，马上就燃烧起来。然后他们又新添了几层碎矿石，堆成一大堆，外面盖上干土和野草，还留下通气的窟窿，好象在把一堆木柴烧成木炭似的。
硫化铁变成硫酸铁和矾土变成硫酸铝的过程至少需要十天到十二天，他们经过上述的安排以后，就让它自己去变化，不再照料了。硫酸铁和硫酸铝都能在水中溶解，可是其他如火石、焦炭、灰渣等是不能在水中溶解的。
在进行这项化学工作的同时，赛勒斯•史密斯继续从事其他的工作，他们干得非常起劲，恨不得一下子就成功。
纳布和潘克洛夫已经把儒艮身上的脂肪全部取下来，装在大陶土罐里了。现在需要用碱化的方法把甘油从脂肪里分离出来。要完成这项工作，一定要有小苏打或石灰，用其中的任何一种分解脂肪，就可以形成肥皂，使甘油分离出来，这种甘油正是工程师想得到的。想用石灰倒很方便，可是这样所得到的是石灰质的肥皂，不能在水里溶解，因此毫无用处。反过来说，如果利用小苏打，就可以得到一种能溶解的肥皂，可供日常使用。赛勒斯•史密斯是一个从实际出发的人，他宁可费事也要弄到小苏打。困难吗？不，因为岸边水生植物很多，有海蓬子、番杏和各种漂上岸来的马尾藻科。他们把这种植物大量地收集起来，先把它们晒干，然后在露天的坑洞里焚烧。他们一连烧了好几天，结果得到许多灰色的粉末，很久以来，人们就把这种物质叫做“天然小苏打”。
有了小苏打，工程师就用来和脂肪化合，结果既得到了可以溶解的肥皂，又有了中性物质——甘油。
可是这还不算完。为了将来的工作着想，赛勒斯•史密斯还需要另外一样东西，那就是硝酸钾，通常叫做硝盐，也叫硝石盐。
赛勒斯•史密斯可以用硝酸和碳酸钾化合制成硝酸钾，碳酸钾很容易从植物灰里面取到。成问题的是硝酸，如果硝酸不象别的物质那样，伸手就可拿到的话，他就会遇到一些困难了。幸而赫伯特在富兰克林山麓发现了一个硝盐矿脉，他们只要把这种盐提炼一下就行了。
这些不同的工作继续了一个星期，在硫化铁没有变成硫酸铁以前就完成了。剩下几天，居民们抓紧时间，砌了一个特殊的砖炉，预备蒸馏尚未制得的硫酸铁。到5月18日左右，这一切几乎和化学变化同时完成了。几天来，吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫在工程师聪明的指导下，成了最能干的工人。实际需要是最能使人信服和最善于教导人的老师。
大堆的黄铁矿石经过加热以后，完全还原了，他们把得到的硫酸铁、硫酸铝、火石、炭渣和灰烬全放在一只盛满了水的盆子里，把这种混合物搅和一阵，接着让它沉淀，然后把水倒出来，得到一种含有硫酸铁溶液和硫酸铝溶液的纯净液体，其他不能溶解的物质，还保持着固体的状态。最后，蒸发了的一部分液体，形成硫酸铁的结晶，其余含有硫酸铝的没有蒸发过的液体就不要了。
赛勒斯•史密斯现在有大量的硫酸铁结晶可以用来提取硫酸。制造硫酸需要很大成本。有不少设备都是必需的，如：一套特殊的工具、白金的仪器、不怕酸类腐蚀的铅室——用来在里面进行化学变化——等等。这些东西工程师手里一样也没有，可是他知道，特别是在波希米亚，有一种非常简单的制造硫酸的方法，这种方法也有一个优点，能够生产浓度很高的硫酸。“北欧硫酸”就是用这种方法制成的。
赛勒斯•史密斯制造硫酸的最后一道工序，是把硫酸铁的结晶密封在瓶子里，进行锻烧，使之蒸发为水汽，经过冷却，就可以变成硫酸了。
他们把结晶放在锅里，点起炉火，结晶就蒸发成为硫酸，这项工作胜利地完成了。5月20日，也就是开始工作以后的第十二天，工程师获得了大量硫酸，他打算将来要多方面地使用这种化学品。
目前他为什么要这种化学品呢？只是为了制造硝酸，制造硝酸非常简单，只要用硫酸和硝石化合，就可以蒸馏出硝酸来。
可是，他究竟把硝酸用在什么地方呢？伙伴们还不知道，因为他还没有向大家宣布他的目的。
然而，工程师的目的却差不多就要达到了，再经过一道工序，他费尽气力想得到的东西就可以制造出来了。
他事先用蒸发的方法浓缩了甘油，现在他就用一只水槽把少量的硝酸和甘油混合在一起。于是，连冷却剂也不用，就得到好几品脱的黄色混合油液。
在进行最后一道工序的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯为了避免万一爆炸起来危及大家，他离开“石窟”一段距离，找了一个偏僻的地方单独去处理。制成以后，他拿着一只瓶子给他的朋友们看，一面得意洋洋地说：
“这是硝化甘油！”
的确，这是一种可怕的药品，它的爆炸威力大概比普通炸药要大十倍，它的爆炸常常造成事故，可是，自从人们发现了把它制成炸药的方法以后，——就是用一种多孔的、能够吸收液体的固体（粘土或是糖）和它混合起来——再使用这种危险的液体，就比较安全了。不过，当居民们在林肯岛上操作的时候，他们还不知道这种方法。
“我们就用这种液体去炸石头吗？”潘克洛夫怀疑地问道。
“是的，朋友，”工程师说，“这种硝化甘油可以产生极大的力量。由于花岗石非常坚硬，阻力大，爆炸起来就更厉害了。”
“我们什么时候能见识见识呢，史密斯先生？”
“明天，就等着挖埋炸药的坑了。”工程师答道。
第二天，5月21日，天刚亮的时候，工兵们就到格兰特湖东岸一带去了。这里离海滨只有五百英尺。高地从水边起，就向下倾斜，湖水只有一道花岗石外围阻拦着。因此，只要炸开外围，湖水就会从缺口冲出来，形成一条小河，沿着高地的斜坡一直向海滩冲去。这么一来，湖面就会大大的降低，泄水的石洞也会暴露出来，他们的目的就在最后这一点。
在工程师的指导之下，潘克洛夫拿着一把鹤嘴锄，巧妙而有力地凿着花岗石的地面。坑是挖在岸边的斜坡上的，比湖面要低得多。这样岩石炸开以后，就可以有一个相当大的缺口让湖水往外流了。
这项工作费了一些时间，工程师为了要取得更大的效果，决定至少用七夸尔的硝化甘油进行爆炸。潘克洛夫和纳布轮班替换，工作得很好，下午四点钟，就把炸药埋好了。
现在又产生了一个问题，就是怎样点炸药。一般都是利用雷汞爆发引起硝化甘油爆炸的。必须有一股冲力才能爆发，点火只能使它燃烧，而不能产生爆炸。
当然，赛勒斯•史密斯是能够制造雷汞的。虽然他缺少雷粉，但是很容易制造一种类似棉花火药的东西，因为他有的是硝酸。只要把这种药品塞在弹药筒里，再加上硝化甘油，就可以用火绳使它炸裂，产生爆炸。
硝化甘油在撞击之下也能爆炸，这一点赛勒斯•史密斯是知道的。因此他决定采用这一方法，如果不成功，再想别的办法。
事实上，只要把少量的硝化甘油滴在坚硬的石头上，用锤子一击，马上就可以爆炸了。可是要想这么做，敲锤的人就非牺牲不可。于是史密斯设法用一根植物纤维的绳子把一块几斤重的铁正吊在炸药坑洞的上面。另外又用一根长绳子事先沾上硫磺，把它的一端系在第一根绳子的中央，另一端拉到离炸药几英尺以外的地面上。把沾上硫磺的绳子用火点着以后，很快就会烧到和第一根绳子的接头处。只要火烧到接头的地方，第一根绳子就会烧断，铁块也就会砸在硝化甘油上。装备停当以后，工程师教他的伙伴们退到相当远的地方去，他在坑里灌满了硝化甘油，一直灌到跟坑口齐。然后他又在岩石的表面上滴了几滴，这时候岩石上面的铁块已经悬好了。
安放完毕后，史密斯点着了沾有硫磺的绳子，然后离开这里，和伙伴们一起回“石窟”去了。
这根绳子估计要燃烧二十五分钟。果然，在二十五分钟以后，只听见一声惊天动地的爆炸。海岛好象连根都震动了。石块象火山爆发似的冲天飞起。空气的激烈震荡产生出巨大的力量，使“石窟”的岩块都颤动起来。居民们虽然离那里有两英里远，也被掀倒在地上。
湖岸一定炸开了，他们站起身来就往高地上爬，向湖岸直奔而去。
他们欢呼起来！只见花岗石壁上裂开了一大块！一股急流白浪翻滚地穿过高地，从三百英尺高的地方向海滩上直泻下去！
Book 1 Chapter 18
Cyrus Harding's project had succeeded, but, according to his usual habit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he remained motionless. Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy, Pencroft nodded his great head, murmuring these words,--
"Come, our engineer gets on capitally!"
The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it had made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through this new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the old one. The result was, that a short time after the operation the level of the lake would be lowered two feet, or more.
The settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped spears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to the plateau, Top accompanying them.
On the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,--
"Don't you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you have made, one could blow up the whole of our island?"
"Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself," replied the engineer. "It is only a question of quantity."
"Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?" asked the sailor.
"No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid, saltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have not got.
"Oh, captain," replied the sailor, "with a little determination--"
Pencroft had erased the word "impossible" from the dictionary of Lincoln Island.
The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately towards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now uncovered. This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no longer rushed through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the interior.
In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake, and a glance showed them that the object had been attained.
In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the water, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like the mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.
The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening, in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that the declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the level of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in the interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.
"Well, captain, what are we stopping for?" asked the sailor, impatient to enter the narrow passage. You see Top has got before us!"
"Very well," replied the engineer. "But we must see our way. Neb, go and cut some resinous branches."
Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made into torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus Harding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the overplus of the lake had formerly filled.
Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able to stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time, was very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending mountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular steps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the rocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and the explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable stalactites. The engineer examined this black granite. There was not a stratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact, and of an extremely close grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the island. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it. Pluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall traces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing of the water had not been able totally to efface.
The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain awe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time visited by human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and the thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in communication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little band, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail to give the alarm if there was any need for it.
After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road, Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up with him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a cavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of water fell from the vault, but that did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply the last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through this cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but producing no mephitic exhalation.
"Well, my dear Cyrus," said Gideon Spilett, "here is a very secure retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however, uninhabitable."
"Why uninhabitable?" asked the sailor.
"Because it is too small and too dark."
"Couldn't we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and air?" replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.
"Let us go on with our exploration," said Cyrus Harding. "Perhaps lower down, nature will have spared us this labor."
"We have only gone a third of the way," observed Herbert.
"Nearly a third," replied Harding, "for we have descended a hundred feet from the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther down--"
"Where is Top?" asked Neb, interrupting his master.
They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.
"Most likely he has gone on," said Pencroft.
"Let us join him," replied Harding.
The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he could easily have given an account of its general direction, which went towards the sea.
The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was attracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped and listened. These sounds, carried through the passage as through an acoustic tube, came clearly to the ear.
"That is Top barking!" cried Herbert.
"Yes," replied Pencroft, "and our brave dog is barking furiously!"
"We have our iron-tipped spears," said Cyrus Harding. "Keep on your guard, and forward!"
"It is becoming more and more interesting," murmured Gideon Spilett in the sailor's ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the help of their dog. Top's barking became more and more perceptible, and it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger to which they might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an irresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top.
There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.
Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and at the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears raised, were ready for any emergency which might arise. The enormous cavern was empty. The settlers explored it in every direction. There was nothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued to bark. Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent.
"There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake reached the sea," said the engineer.
"Of course," replied Pencroft, "and we must take care not to tumble into a hole."
"Go, Top, go!" cried Harding.
The dog, excited by his master's words, ran towards the extremity of the cavern, and there redoubled his barking.
They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth of a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped; and this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture.
The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin, whose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its fall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The flame then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached the water, that is to say, the level of the sea.
The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety feet.
The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the level of the sea.
"Here is our dwelling," said Cyrus Harding.
"But it was occupied by some creature," replied Gideon Spilett, whose curiosity was not yet satisfied.
"Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this opening," replied the engineer, "and has left the place for us."
"Never mind," added the sailor, "I should like very much to be Top just for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn't bark for nothing!"
Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were near him might have heard him murmur these words,--
"Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many things."
However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied. Chance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them great service. They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size of which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their torches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by means of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as a spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return. The place was free.
Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this excavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of rendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think of lighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea might be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly calculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage, and was therefore led to believe that the outer wall could not be very thick. If light was thus obtained, so would a means of access, for it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to establish an exterior ladder.
Harding made known his ideas to his companions.
"Then, captain, let us set to work!" replied Pencroft. "I have my pickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I strike?"
"Here," replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable recess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.
Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the torches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then Spilett took Neb's place.
This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot the wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by Gideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.
"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried Pencroft.
The wall only measured there three feet in thickness.
Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground from a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea-coast, the islet, and beyond the open sea.
Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and producing a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than thirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and its vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet.
In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the vaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral piers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing themselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses could be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections formed like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque mixture of all the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced by the hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone had hollowed this fairy Aihambra in a mass of granite.
The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only expected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous palace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported into a temple!
Cries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.
"Ah, my friends!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding, "when we have lighted the interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in the left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will make our study and our museum!"
"And we will call it?--" asked Herbert.
"Granite House," replied Harding; a name which his companions again saluted with a cheer.
The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the next day.
Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well, which descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened attentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths. A flaming branch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were lighted up for an instant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.
If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the water, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean passage, before the new opening had been offered to him.
Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the gulf, without uttering a word.
The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, "Captain!" said he.
"What do you want, my friend?" asked the engineer, as if he had returned from the land of dreams.
"The torches will soon go out."
"Forward!" replied Cyrus Harding.
The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark passage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The ascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the upper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long granite staircase. Then they began to climb again.
Soon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no longer sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The one which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their way in the dark, they must hasten.
This was done, and a little before four o'clock, at the moment when the sailor's torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions passed out of the passage.
赛勒斯•史密斯的计划成功了，但是他还和过去一样，没有满足的表示，他紧闭着嘴唇，眼睛睁得大大的，一动也不动地站着。赫伯特却高兴得几乎发了狂，纳布乐得手舞足蹈，潘克洛夫点着他的大脑袋，自言自语他说：
“好，我们的工程师真有办法！”
硝化甘油的确发挥了极大的威力。它所炸开的新出口非常大，流出来的水至少要比从旧道排出的多三倍。爆炸以后不久，湖面就会降低三英尺，也许还要多些。
居民们到“石窟”里去拿了几把鹤嘴锄和铁头标枪，还有一些纤维绳索、火石和钢块；然后回到高地上来，托普也跟着他们一起来了。
一路上水手忍不住对工程师说：
“你做的那种油实在好，用它能把我们的海岛全都炸毁，你说是不是，史密斯先生？”
“不用说海岛，连大陆、全世界都可以，”工程师答道。“只是数量多少的问题。”
“那么你能用硝化甘油来做弹药吗？”水手问道。
“不能，潘克洛夫；它太容易爆炸了。可是要做一些棉花火药，甚至是普通的火药都不算难，因为我们有硝酸、硝石、硫磺和炭，不幸的是我们没有枪。”
“啊，史密斯先生，”水手答道，“只要有决心就能办到……”
潘克洛夫已经把“难”字从林肯岛的字典上抹去了。
格兰特湖原有的出口现在已经露出来。居民们来到眺望岗上，立刻就向那里走去。这个出口已经没有湖水在流，现在可以走人了。肯定地说，他们可以毫不困难地察看洞内。
几分钟以后，居民们来到湖的南端，他们一眼就看出目的已经达到了。
果然，湖里露出了他们搜求了很久的洞口，现在这个洞口已经在水面上了。湖水下降以后，留下一道狭长的分水线，使他们可以走近洞口。这个洞口横宽约二十英尺，但是高度却几乎还不到两英尺。它的样子很象人行道边下水道的沟口，因此居民们要想进去很不容易。可是纳布和潘克洛夫抡起鹤嘴锄，很快就把洞口凿到一个合适的高度。
然后工程师走向前来，他发现洞里的坡道斜度最多也不过三十到三十五度，至少洞口一带是这样的，因此是可以通行的。如果往前走坡度不变陡，甚至一直向海面走下去都不困难。花岗石的内壁里很可能有巨大的石洞，如果真是这样，也许会有极大的用处的。
“怎么，史密斯先生，我们呆着干什么？”水手问道，他急于要到狭长的甬道里去。“你看，托普已经进去了！”
“很好，”工程师答道。“可是我们一定要看得见道路。纳布，去砍一些带树脂的枯树枝来。”
纳布和赫伯特跑到湖边去了。这一带长着许多松树和其他的苍翠树木，他们很快就带了一些树枝回来，做成火把。用火石和钢片把它们点着，于是赛勒斯•史密斯就带领着大家冒险进入原来灌满湖水的漆黑的甬道。
出乎他们的意料之外，探险家们愈往前走，甬道的直径也就愈大，走了一会工夫，他们能够站直身子了。这里的花岗石经过流水长年的冲洗，又湿又滑，走在上面随时都有摔跤的危险。于是居民们采用了爬山时常用的办法，用一根绳索把大家连起来。幸而有些花岗石向外凸出，形成天然的梯阶，这样往下走去就不至于摔跤了。在火把的照耀下，有许多水珠在石头上闪闪发光，探险家们估计石壁上可能垂着无数的钟乳石。工程师仔细察着了这黑色的花岗石。上面看不出地层，连一条缝也没有。石头是整体的，而且石纹非常细致。估计从有海岛的那一天起，就已经有这条甬道了。它并不是由流水逐渐冲出来的。一手造成这个石洞的不是尼普顿而是柏鲁图，石壁上还遗有熔岩的痕迹，长期的水流冲刷也没能把它们完全磨灭。
居民们往下走得很慢。这个石洞还是第一次有人来，谁也不知道它究竟有多深。他们冒险往深处走，不由得产生了一种无名的恐惧。他们谁都不说话，然而脑子里却不住地在想，而且想的还不止一件事。这个地洞通向大海，也许有水螅和其他巨大的头足类动物住在里面吧。好在托普在小队的前面走着，他们可以依靠它的机智。在紧要关头，它是决不会不发警报的。
他们沿着曲折的道路，大约走了一百英尺的光景。走在前面的史密斯站住了，他的伙伴们也到了他的跟前。他们站脚的地方很宽，这里是一个大小适中的山洞。顶上一滴一滴地往下掉水，然而大家很清楚，水不是从岩石里渗出来的。只不过是多少年来在石洞里奔腾而过的急流所剩下的一点残迹罢了。这里的空气虽然有些潮湿，然而却很新鲜，没有丝毫浊气。
“亲爱的赛勒斯，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“这个地方正在岩石的深处，藏身倒很安全，可是不能住人。”
“为什么不能住人？”水手问道。
“因为太小了，光线又暗。”
“我们不能把它扩大一些，凿得更深一点，再开几个窟窿透亮和通风吗？”潘克洛夫答道，他现在认为没有一件事情是办不到的。
“我们继续搜索吧，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“也许再往下一些，大自然会让我们省下这番气力的。”
“我们才走了三分之一的路程。”赫伯特说。
“将近三分之一，”史密斯说，“我们才从洞口往下走了一百英尺，不可能一百英尺以下就……”
“托普上哪儿去了？”纳布打断了他主人的话问道。
他们在附近搜索了一会儿，可是托普并不在这里。
“它大概往前走了。”潘克洛夫说。
“我们跟上去吧。”史密斯说。
他们继续往下走去。工程师每到甬道拐弯的地方，就特另注意，虽然曲折很多，他还是能毫不困难地说出大概的方向。石洞是通向大海的。
居民们又走了五十英尺左右，忽然听见下面很远的地方有一种声音。他们停下来听了一会儿。甬道象一个传声筒似的送过一些声音来，听起来非常清楚。
“是托普在叫！”赫伯特喊道。
“就是它，”潘克洛夫说，“我们勇敢的狗在愤怒地叫呢！”
“我们有铁头的标枪，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“提防着，向前进！”
“愈来愈奇怪了。”吉丁•史佩莱在水手的耳边悄悄地说，水手点点头。史密斯和他的伙伴们急忙奔去，准备帮助他们的狗，托普的叫声愈来愈清晰，它好象愤怒得出奇。是不是它侵犯了什么动物的窝，双方正在搏斗呢？探险家们在好奇心驱使下，连可能遇到的危险也不顾了。过了几分钟，他们又往下走了十六英尺，找到了托普。
甬道到头了。这里是一个宽敞而高大的石洞，托普来回乱跑，愤怒地狂叫着。潘克洛夫和纳布手里举着火把，把每一个缝隙都照亮了。这时候史密斯、吉丁、史佩莱和赫伯特拿着标枪，随时防备任何可能发生的紧急事故。宽大的石洞里空空如也，什么也没有。居民们到处都搜查遍了，里面没有任何东西，没有一只野兽，更没有一个人，然而托普还是继续在叫。抚摩也好，呵斥也好，都不能使它安静下来。
“湖水一定是在这里通过什么地方流到海里去的。”工程师说。
“当然，”潘克洛夫说，“大家可都要留神，不要掉到窟窿里去。”
“走，托普，走！”史密斯喊道。
托普被它的主人一喊，就激奋地跑到石洞的尽头去了，它在那里叫得更加起劲。
他们跟上前去，用火把一照，看见花岗石地面上有一个洞，简直就象一口正规的井。湖水就是通过它排出去的。这里面不是什么倾斜的、可以通行的甬道，而是一口直上直下的井，要想冒险下去是不可能的。
他们将火把凑到井口来：什么也看不见。史密斯把一根点着了的树枝在深渊里扔去。树枝火在迅速下坠的时候更加明亮，它照亮了井的内部，然而还是看不见任何东西。只听见嗤的一声，火灭了，说明树枝已经落在水里，也就是海面。
工程师根据树枝坠落的时间，算出井的深度大概在九十英尺左右。
因此，这里的地面一定在海拔九十英尺的地方。
“这就是我们的住所，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“可是这里有什么兽类住着呢。”吉丁•史佩莱说，他的好奇心还没有满足。
“不管是不是两栖动物，反正它已经从井里逃出去，”工程师答道，“把地方让给我们了。”
“不管怎么说，”水手说，“托普是从来也不无缘无故乱叫的！我真想变成托普，哪怕只是一刻钟也好。”
赛勒斯•史密斯看看他的狗，喃喃地说：
“是的，我相信托普比我们多知道很多事情。”靠近他的伙伴也许会听见这句话。
无论如何，居民们的希望总算大部分得到满足了。一方面是由于机会，另一方面也由于他们领袖的惊人智慧，使他们得到很多的好处。他们现在已经占有了一个巨大的石洞，虽然火把的光线太暗，还没法准确估计石洞到底有多大，然而肯定是可以用砖头把它隔成许多房间的，即使不能把它当作一幢住宅，至少也可以作为一间宽大的公寓。湖水改道以后，再也不会回来了。这个地方可以随便利用。
目前还有两个困难：首先，怎样能使这个岩石中间的洞窟得到阳光；其次，必须想法子使进出方便一些，头顶上的花岗石很厚，要想从上面取得光源是不可能的，因此只有把临向大海的岩壁凿穿。赛勒斯•史密斯在走下来的时候，大致估计了一下甬道的坡度和长度，他认为外壁不可能太厚。如果能让光线从这里进来，那么也一定能够打开一扇门，因为门和窗凿起来都一样，只是需要在外面安装一个梯子，这也不是难事。
史密斯把他的想法告诉了大家。
“那么，史密斯先生，我们就开始干吧！”潘克洛夫说。“我这儿有鹤嘴锄，很快就可以把墙壁凿透。你告诉我在哪儿动手啊？”
“这儿，”工程师说，他把强壮的水手带到一个地方，这里的石壁凹进去相当深，岩石的厚度比别处要薄得多。
潘克洛夫在火把的照耀下向花岗石进攻了。碎石迸得到处都是。凿了半个钟头，纳布上去替换他，然后吉丁•史佩莱又替换了纳布。
他们继续干了两个钟头，开始怀疑了，觉得这里大概不是鹤嘴锄能凿通的。正在这时候，吉丁•史佩莱最后一锄竟凿穿了岩石，工具脱手掉到外边去了。
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊了起来。
这里的石壁只有三英尺厚。
史密斯把眼睛凑在壁孔上，这里离地面有八十英尺。前面伸展着海岸和小岛，远处是辽阔无边的海洋。
阳光透过缺口，照亮了这个壮丽宏伟的石洞。石洞左边的高度和宽度都至多不过三十英尺，右边却非常宽敞，圆形的顶壁高达八十英尺以上。
洞里的穹窿就好象教堂中央的圆顶，由许多不规则的花岗石柱支持着。这些石柱有的象侧面的扶壁，有的象椭圆形的拱门，上面点缀着许多刻划鲜明的花纹。在阴暗的角落里，还隐藏着许多突出的图案，象挂着的装饰品似的。通过这些石柱所形成的奇形怪状的拱门，隐隐约约透过一些光线来。这个山洞象是人类所有的拜占庭、罗马和哥特式建筑艺术的综合体。然而这却是大自然创造出来的。大自然在花岗石中一手造成了这亚亨伯拉式的洞天福地。
居民们不住赞赏这个地方。他们原先以为这里只有一个狭小的石洞，结果却发现了一座神奇的官殿，纳布象进了大庙似的，把帽子也摘下来了！
人人都大声地赞不绝口。欢笑声充满了石洞，回音反复传播，最后才消失在黑暗的中堂里。
“喂，朋友们！”赛勒斯•史密斯大声说，“等我们在这里开了窗户以后，我们就把左边当作房间和仓库，这一边壮丽的石洞要留作书房和我们的博物馆！”
“我们给它起一个什么名字呢？”赫伯特问道。
“‘花岗石宫’。”史密斯说。他的伙伴们听了以后，又欢呼起来，表示赞同。
火把已经快烧完了，他们不得不再从甬道回到高地上去。大家决定把整理新住宅的必要工作放到第二天再做。
临走以前，赛勒斯•史密斯又趴在黑黝黝的井口上探望了一下井底的海面，并且仔细听了一会凡。井底丝毫没有响动，连深处常有的汹涌波涛声也没有。他又往下扔了一根燃烧的树枝。一刹那间，照亮了井的周围，然而还是和第一次一样，没有看见任何可疑的东西。
即使有什么水怪由于潮水突然不流一时找不到新的出口而大吃一惊，现在一定也已经从这条地下通道回到大海里去了。
工程师呆呆地站在那里，注视着深渊，一句话也不说。
水手走到他的身边，碰了一下他的胳膊，喊道：“史密斯先生！”
“什么事，朋友？”工程师好象刚从梦中醒来，开口反问。
“火把就要灭了。”
“走吧！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
小队离开了石洞，开始往漆黑的甬道上爬去。托普跟在最后，还不时低低咆哮。往上走是相当困难的。居民们在上面的石洞里休息了几分钟。在这漫长的花岗石梯阶上，这里好象是一个中途的休息站。接着他们又继续往上爬去。
不久就呼吸到比较新鲜的空气了。石壁上晶莹的水滴已经蒸发掉了。光亮的火把开始黯淡下来，纳布手里的一支已经熄灭了。如果不想在黑暗中瞎摸，就必须加速前进。
他们加快了步伐，将近四点钟的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们走出了甬道；这时候，水手的火把也灭了。
Book 1 Chapter 19
The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling was commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient shelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst of solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky. Their former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for the engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works. Cyrus Harding's first care was to find out the position of the front of Granite House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be sufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite.
The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a perpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they evidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for them. It was the engineer's intention to divide the right portion of the cavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light it by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft was much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the use of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through which it would always be easy to enter Granite House.
"My friend," replied Harding, "if it is easy for us to reach our dwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides us. I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it hermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance by making a dam, and thus causing the water of the lake to rise."
"And how shall we get in?" asked the sailor.
"By an outside ladder," replied Cyrus Harding, "a rope ladder, which, once drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible."
"But why so many precautions?" asked Pencroft. "As yet we have seen no dangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don't believe it!"
"Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?" asked the engineer, looking at the sailor.
"Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every direction," replied Pencroft.
"Yes," said Harding, "for we know only a small portion of it as yet. But at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from the exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be provided against every contingency."
Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection, Pencroft prepared to execute his orders.
The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a door, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would admit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be their chief room. This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above the ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with its first rays. It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which was between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular line traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus the winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was protected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were made, the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be concealed in need.
The first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long with the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious man. He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he employed it usefully. By means of this explosive substance the rock was broken open at the very places chosen by the engineer. Then, with the pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days alter the beginning of the work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun, whose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the plan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five compartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a door, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a dining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping- room, of equal size; and lastly, a "Visitor's room," petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was next to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms, would not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores would be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as the fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation, and completely sheltered from the damp. There was no want of space, so that each object could be methodically arranged. Besides, the colonists had still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern, which was like the garret of the new dwelling.
This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners became brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of Granite House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered the cavern by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them first to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river's bank, and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great loss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore, resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House completely inaccessible.
This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed of the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick cable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with light, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly hand of Pencroft.
Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a tackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be raised into Granite House. The transport of the materials being thus simplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately. There was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there ready to be used. The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very roughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms and storehouses, according to the plan agreed upon.
These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came amiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and zealous companions. They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft always having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes rope- maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to all the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer was complete; nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of undertaking anything and succeeding in everything. The question of boots and clothes--assuredly a serious question,--that of light during the winter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming the wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus Harding helping, everything would be done in time. He dreamed of canals facilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings of quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture; railroads; yes, railroads! of which a network would certainly one day cover Lincoln Island.
The engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of this brave heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled to hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future which he felt. In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course of vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them. It was on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend, for the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that to hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction, would be a serious and perilous thing.
"But," as the sailor said, "they quite took the wind out of the sails of the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle."
In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.
Herbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and active; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding became more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and reverent love for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close sympathy which existed between the two, but he was not in the least jealous. Neb was Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal, devotion, self-denial personified. He had the same faith in his master that Pencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently. When the sailor was enthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would say, "Nothing could be more natural." Pencroft and he were great friends.
As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less skilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished the sailor. A "journalist," clever, not only in understanding, but in performing everything.
The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less than a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet. Harding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting by an overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above the ground. This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a sort of platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the oscillation was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be raised to the level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was secured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at its upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had been made much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish an hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time, for the inhabitants of Granite House.
The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were light and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up the masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But it was also necessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his four paws, was not formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft was such a zealous master, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not be said that the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once Pencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.
It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively conducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question was not neglected. Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been voted purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase. As yet, they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for want of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the immense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been given, were not explored. They reserved this important excursion for the first fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game; kangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters iron-tipped spears and bows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow, covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such as thyme, basil, savory, all the sweet-scented species of the labiated plants, which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of.
On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the rabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting, the two sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any rate, it produced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom. Herbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony, etc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral, astringent, febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When, afterwards, Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,--
"For medicine," replied the lad, "to treat us when we are ill."
"Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?" asked Pencroft quite seriously.
There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his collection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House. Besides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America as "Oswego tea," which made an excellent beverage.
At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site of the warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.
"Here are the burrows!" cried Herbert.
"Yes," replied the reporter, "so I see."
"But are they inhabited?"
"That is the question."
This was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals, similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that even Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these rodents escaped them easily. But the reporter resolved not to leave the place, until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds. He wished to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they might take later. It would not have been difficult to do this, with a few snares stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at this moment they had neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must, therefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it with a stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in any other way.
At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes. They were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by the name of American rabbits.
This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured at the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be despised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the colony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.
On the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only to be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A chimney was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen. The pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to these amateur bricklayers. It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of brick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to be thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of the kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps the winds which blew directly against the facade would make the chimney smoke, but these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was not so very particular about that.
When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any access by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan of drowning this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring them to their former level by means of a dam. He contented himself with hiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the interstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly. However, he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh water to the new dwelling. A little trench, made below their level, produced this result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible source yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be any want of water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and it was time, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the windows of the facade, until the engineer had time to make glass.
Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections around the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming grass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which had a pleasing effect.
The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not but be charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over a boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the north, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union Bay was spread before them. Yes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he humorously called, "his apartments on the fifth floor above the ground!"
第二天是5月22日，他们开始布置新房了。的确，由于“石窟”不够住，居民们都想早些搬到这个宽大而合乎卫生的住宅里来，这个住宅隐藏在坚固的岩石里，海水灌不着，雨水打不到。然而他们并没有完全放弃故居，工程师打算把它开辟成重要工作的作坊。赛勒斯•史密斯首先想从外面找到“花岗石宫”的正面。他来到海滩上，通讯记者甩掉的鹤嘴锄一定从峭壁上直落下来，只要找到鹤嘴锄就可以发现凿穿花岗石的地方了。
他们一下子就找到了鹤嘴锄。鹤嘴锄掉下来以后已经陷在泥沙里了。他们就从这一点一直望上去，发现了那个缺口。已经有几只野鸽在这个小洞口飞进飞出了，它们显然认为“花岗石宫”是专为它们开辟的。工程师主张把石洞的右部分成几间，前面留一条过道，另外再在迎面开五扇窗子和一扇门，用来透光。潘克洛夫对于开五扇窗子这一点非常同意，可是他不明白门的用途，他认为甬道就是“花岗石宫”的天然梯阶，从这里出来进去并没有什么困难。
“朋友，”史密斯说，“如果我们图方便，从甬道里走进住宅，那么其他的人要进去也同样是方便的。我的意思和你相反，要把那个入口堵死，如果必要的话，再做一道堤坝，使湖水重新升高，把入口完全淹下去。”
“那么我们怎么进去呢？”水手问道。
“从外面用梯子上去，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道，“用绳子做一个软梯，只要一吊起来，就谁也进不了我们的住宅了。”
“你干吗要这么胆小呢？”潘克洛夫问道。“直到目前，我们还没有见到过什么猛兽。要是说我们岛上有土人，那我可不相信！”
“你能肯定吗，潘克洛夫？”工程师看着水手问道。
“我们还没有查遍全岛，当然没法完全肯定啦。”潘克洛夫说。
“是呵，”史密斯说，“到目前为止，我们才了解它的一小部分。再说，即使我们岛内没有敌人，外面还是可能有敌人来的，因为太平洋的某些地方非常危险。我们必须防备一切意外。”
赛勒斯•史密斯的话是很英明的。潘克洛夫没有继续反对，准备执行他的命令了。
于是大家一致同意在“花岗石宫”的正面开五扇窗和一道门，此外，还要开一扇往外凸出的大窗子和几个比较小的椭圆形窗孔，以便透进大量的光线。他们这样打算，就是要把这间奇妙的中堂作为主要的房间。“花岗石宫”的正面高出地面八十英尺，朝着正东，太阳一升起来，首先就会把它照亮。他们发现如果从形成“石窟”的乱石堆上画一条垂直线到地面来，那么“花岗石宫”在峭壁上的位置就正在这条线和慈悲河口峭壁凸出的地方中间。由于有凸出的峭壁遮挡着，东北风只能从侧面吹来。此外，工程师还打算在窗架做好以前，先安上厚实的百叶窗，把窗洞挡起来，避免室内遭到风吹雨打，在必要的时候，还能把这些百叶窗隐蔽起来。
第一步工作就是凿洞。如果单靠鹤嘴锄，那不知道要费多少时间才能完成。好在大家都知道史密斯精明强干，他还有一部分硝化甘油没有用完，正好在这件工作上发挥了它的效用。工程师利用这种炸药把在石壁上选定的地方准确地炸开。然后，大家就用鹤嘴锄和铲子把门窗凿成一定的形状，粗糙的边缘也磨平了。这样工作了几天，早上的阳光就大量地透进“花岗石宫”来，连最隐蔽的角落都照亮了。根据赛勒斯•史密斯的计划，下一步应该把石洞分成面临海洋的五间空房；最右边开一道门作为进口，门外安上梯子；然后是一间三十英尺长的厨房，四十英尺长的饭厅和同样大小的寝室；还有一间“会客室”，这是根据潘克洛夫的请求而设的；再往左就是大厅了。这些房间——实际上是一套房间——并没有把整个石洞都占掉。因此他们还打算设一个走廊和一间仓库，他们的工具、食品和储备物资都可以藏在仓库里。这是个很好的保存东西的地方。岛上的各种物产，动物和植物，放在这里完全不会受潮。这里地方很宽，可以井井有条地把每一样东西放在一处。并且，除了这个大石洞以外，上面还有一个小石洞，可以供他们随便利用；这个小石洞好象是新居的气楼一样。
计划拟定以后，只等实行了。工兵们又成了制砖工人。砖头烧成以后，就搬到“花岗石宫”下边来了。直到目前，史密斯和他的伙伴们一直都是通过狭长的甬道进洞的。他们必须先爬上眺望岗，绕过河岸，然后在甬道里往下走二百英尺，要想回到高地上来，就还要往上爬同样长的一段距离。这样不但浪费许多时间，而且也非常吃力。因此赛勒斯•史密斯决定不再拖延，立刻开始制造结实的绳梯。以后只要把梯子拉起来，就没有上“花岗石宫”的道路了。
软梯做得非常讲究，梯帮是用一种爬藤植物的桑韧纤维做成的，和粗索差不多结实。横档用的是红杉的树枝，既轻巧又结实，这套设备是由绳梯专家潘克洛夫一手做成的。
另外他们又用植物纤维编成一些绳子，在门上拴了一个辘轳，装置起一架类似起重机的工具。这样就可以毫不费力地把砖头运到“花岗石宫”上去了。由于材料的运输工作简化了，内部的整修工作就可以立刻开始。他们有的是石灰；砖头存了几千块，也随时可以使用。隔间的初坯马上就砌起来了；起初显得非常简陋，可是不久以后，石洞就完全按照通过的计划，隔成了房间和仓库。
工程师亲自拿着锤子和刮刀带头干，各项工作进行得非常迅速。他没有一种工作不愿意干，他总是以身作则，为聪明而热情的伙伴树立良好的榜样。他们对工作很有信心，干起来非常愉快。潘克洛夫老爱说笑话，他一会儿当木工，一会儿当绳索工，一会儿当泥水工，总是给这个小小的世界制造着笑料。他对工程师佩服得五体投地，不管什么也不能改变他的信仰。他认为工程师是一个万能博士，任何一件事情都能做成。穿衣裳（这的确是一个严重的问题）、冬季室内的照明、利用岛上的肥沃土地以及把野生植物变为栽培植物等问题，这一切在他看来都很容易，有赛勒斯•史密斯帮助，到时候一切都能解决的。他还梦想着开几条运河，以便运输岛上丰富的物产；开矿，制造各种工业生产的机器；修铁路；不错，铁路！肯定地说，林肯岛上的铁路息有一天会稠密得象蜘蛛网似的。
工程师让潘克洛夫一个人自言自语。他没有使这位勇士扫兴。他知道信心是带有感染性的；他甚至一边听他说，一边微笑着，绝口不提他认为日后会遇到的困难。事实上，在这航线以外的太平洋地区里，他们可能一辈子也得不到人们的援助。居民们只有依靠自己，别的什么也得不到，因为林肯岛和任何一个岛屿都离得很远，他们又不可能造出很好的船来，如果要想冒险乘小船出发航海，那就太危险了。
“可是，”正如水手所说的，“鲁宾逊象奇迹似的得到了一切，而我们却占了鲁宾逊的上风。”
事实上，他们的精力非常旺盛，在一个懒汉必然死亡的地方，他们是可以成功的。
赫伯特在这一段工作里表现得非常突出。他既聪明又活泼，学得快，干得好，赛勒斯•史密斯越发喜欢这个少年了。赫伯特对工程师也怀着一种热情而尊敬的爱。潘克洛夫看到他们彼此亲近，丝毫没有嫉妒的意思。纳布还是和往常一样：一贯表现着勇敢、热心、忠诚、无私的美好品德。他和潘克洛夫同样崇拜他的主人，可是表现得不那么热烈。每当潘克洛夫兴高采烈的时候，纳布总是带着一种表情，好象在说，“这有什么稀奇。”然而潘克洛夫和他却是好朋友，他们很快就用“你”来互相称呼了。
吉丁•史佩莱在共同的事业中也分担了辛劳，而且干得非常熟练，并不比伙伴们差，这一点水手总是非常诧异。这个“新闻记者”不仅会分析问题，做起后来竟也这么能干。
软梯终于在5月28日装妥了。在八十英尺的垂直高度上，至少有一百档梯阶。也是运气，离地面四十英尺的光景，峭壁上有一个凸出的地方，史密斯就利用这里把软梯分成两截。他们用鹤嘴锄仔细把凸出部分凿开，形成一座平台，然后把第一段梯子从这里系下去，这样摇晃的程度就减少了一半，而且还可以用一根绳子把软梯吊到“花岗石宫”上去。第二段梯子的下端固定在平台上，上端系在“花岗石宫”的门口。总之，现在上去要容易得多了。此外赛勒斯•史密斯还打算将来装置一种水力机械，那时候，就可以完全不用“花岗石宫”里的居民浪费时间和气力了。
居民们很快就习惯用软梯上下了。他们的胳膊和大腿固然都很灵便，但这和潘克洛夫的指导是分不开的，因为他是个水手，是爬惯了桅杆和帆索的。托普更是非教不可。照理说这只可怜的四条腿的狗，实在不适于受这种训练。可是经过潘克洛夫热心的教导，托普最后居然也能勉强攀登，而且不久它的爬梯技能大可以和马戏团里的同类相媲美了。不用说，水手有这样一个学徒，是感到十分骄傲的。然而，潘克洛夫有时候还是背着它攀登，托普自然也不拒绝。
必须说明，当上述工作正进行得热火朝天的时候——因为寒冷的季节快到了——大家也没有忘记吃的问题。通讯记者和赫伯特被公推为小队里的食品采办员，他们每天都要抽出几个钟头去打猎，到目前为止，他们活动的范围只是在啄木鸟林以及河的左岸一带，由于缺少桥梁和船只，他们还不能过慈悲河。被命名为“远西”的大片密林也没有探索过。这项重要的探险工作打算留到开春以后天气转暖的时候再进行，然而啄木鸟林就是一个鸟兽群聚的地方，这里有的是袋鼠和野猪，猎人们的标枪和弓箭神出鬼没，经常打到很多。此外赫伯特还在湖的西南发现了一片天然的养兔场，这是一片稍微有些潮湿的草地，到处都有杨柳枝条摇曳，各种各样的香草散发着阵阵清香，其中有麝香草、“罗勒”、香薄荷以及各种唇形科的芳香植物，这些都是兔子所特别喜欢吃的。
通讯记者认为这片草地既然是天造地设的养兔场，如果没有兔子，那未免有些奇怪，于是这两个猎人就仔细地搜索起来。这里生长着许多珍贵的植物，对自然学家来说，在这里研究植物界的品种倒是一个极好的机会。赫伯特搜集了几把“罗勒”、迷迭香、薄荷、郭公草等等的嫩芽，它们各有各的医药用途，有的可以治肺病，有的可以作为收敛剂，有的可以作为退热剂，还有的可以防止痉挛或风湿症。潘克洛夫问这些草弄来有什么用。
“下药，”少年答道，“留到生病的时候吃。”
“岛上又没有医生，我们为什么要生病呢？”潘克洛夫一本正经地问道。
少年没有回答这个问题，还是继续搜集，“花岗石宫”里的人对这件事都表示非常欢迎。除了这些药草以外，少年又带回一种北美洲的“薄荷茶”，可以用它泡成非常可口的饮料。
经过彻底的搜查以后，猎人们终于找到真正的养兔场了。这里满地都是窟窿，象筛子似的。
“到了兔子的老家了！”赫伯特喊道。
“不错，”通讯记者说，“我看也是的。”
“可是它们在家吗？”
“那很难说。”
这个问题马上就得到解答了，话还没有说完，就有成千类似兔子的小动物向四面八方逃去，它们跑得极快，连托普也追不上。猎人和狗白赶了一阵，这些啮齿动物都轻易地逃走了。可是通讯记者不死心，决定至少要逮住半打再走。他打算先抓来充实他们的食品室，以后有工夫再捉来驯养。要想捉住它们并不困难，只要在洞口布置几个圈套就行了。可是，眼前没有圈套，又没有东西可以制造。他们只好到每个洞里去搜寻，把棍子伸进去搅一阵，别的方法既然无效，他们就只好耐心等待了。
半个钟头以后，他们终于在洞里捉住四只兔子。这种啮齿动物和欧洲种差不多，一般称为美洲兔。
他们把捉住的兔子带回“花岗石宫”，晚餐的时候，就作为主菜端出来了。谁都没有瞧不起养兔场的住客——美洲兔，因为它滋味很美。这是小队的一个有价值的资源，而且看起来好象永远也吃不完。
5月31日，隔间的工程完毕了。房间里只差添设一些家具，这项工作打算在漫长的冬季进行。他们把第一间房作为厨房，里面砌了一个烟囱。业余制砖工人们感到把烟通到外面去的烟囱很难做。史密斯认为要想凿一个出口通到上面的高地去是不可能的，最简单的方法是用砖头砌烟囱；于是就在厨房的窗子上面开了一个小洞，烟囱象铁炉的炉管一样，从洞里通出去。如果有风迎面吹来，烟囱也许会倒烟的，然而迎面吹来的风究竟很少，并且炊事员纳布在这一点上倒也不怎么挑剔。
内部装修完毕以后，工程师就去堵塞湖水原来的出口，这样任何人也不能从这条路进来。他们把大块的岩石滚到入口处去，牢牢地砌在一起。赛勒斯•史密斯并没有按照原来的计划筑堤坝，使湖水恢复原有的高度来淹没洞口。他只是在石缝间种了一些野草和灌木，到了明年春天，这些草木就会长得非常茂密，堵塞的地方就可以一点看不出来了。另外，他还想利用瀑布把淡水引到新居里来。在地面上凿了一道小沟，这个工程就完成了：引来的湖水非常清澈，而且永远也流不完，每天的输水量在二十五加仑到三十加仑之间。“花岗石宫”里再也不会没有水用了。现在，一切都已安排就绪，这些工作完成得非常及时，因为寒冷的季节转眼就要到了。迎面的窗口安有厚厚的百叶窗，关闭时很严紧，只等工程师将来有时间再做玻璃。
吉丁•史佩莱把各种各样的植物，还有许多很长的浮草装饰在窗子周围凸出的岩石上，布置得非常艺术化，窗口好象镶在美丽的绿色框架里一样，看起来清凉悦目。
住在这幢坚固、舒适而且安全的住宅里的人，不禁对自己的成就自我陶醉起来。从窗口望出去是辽阔的天边，北边的尽头是颚骨角的两个部分，南边是爪角。站在窗前可以看得见整个联合湾。的确，我们这些勇敢的居民感到满足不是没有理由的，潘克洛夫对他们的住宅更是赞不绝口，他幽默地把住宅称做“五层楼上的公寓”！
Book 1 Chapter 20
The winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with the month of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers and squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission. The tenants of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling which sheltered them from the inclement weather. The Chimneys would have been quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and it was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption. Cyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as to preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were established there.
During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different occupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder being, therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had leisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great results. He soon made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb employed nearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their always having plenty of provisions. The question of clothes was now seriously discussed, the settlers having no other garments than those they wore when the balloon threw them on the island. These clothes were warm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their linen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be replaced. Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer greatly from cold.
On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide for their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a store of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question of clothes had been settled. They must therefore make up their minds to pass this first winter without additional clothing. When the fine season came round again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been seen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected, the engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How? He would consider.
"Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!" said Pencroft. "There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it."
"Besides," added Gideon Spilett, "Lincoln Island is not situated under a very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did you not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that of Spain in the other hemisphere?"
"Doubtless," replied the engineer, "but some winters in Spain are very cold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as rigourously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that the temperature will be more moderate."
"Why, captain?" asked Herbert.
"Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores this heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium temperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter."
"We shall prove that," replied Pencroft. "But I don't want to bother myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that is that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we talk about the question of light."
"Nothing is easier," replied Harding.
"To talk about?" asked the sailor.
"To settle."
"And when shall we begin?"
"To-morrow, by having a seal hunt."
"To make candles?"
"Yes."
Such was the engineer's project; and it was quite feasible, since he had lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish the fat necessary for the manufacture.
They were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to observe this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered to Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in Lincoln Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the islet. They asked for nothing more--they gave thanks. The next day, the 5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet. They had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was agreed that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they could, a boat which would render communication so much easier, and would also permit them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island, which was put off till the first fine days.
The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped spears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and only brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being intended for the manufacture of boots.
The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all to be employed in the fabrication of candles.
The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely perfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would only have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid with the neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from this new combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and the stearin, by employing boiling water. But to simplify the operation, he preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a calcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.
From these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others, they formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.
This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks, after several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the liquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the hand, which only wanted whiteness and polish. They would not doubtless have the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic acid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but Cyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these candles would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite House.
During this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new dwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which were very rough, and added others also.
Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last able to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their beards. Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were bristling in a way which justified the making of the said scissors.
The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an instrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the ligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards, to furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding consisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which rested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb worked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist's laboratory.
But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two bridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now the plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse, which had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island. To avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour, by climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was to establish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to five and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter's work that was needed was to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some days. Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited by them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the downs. They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the former inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters, which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of the Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists consumed some daily.
It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as yet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost all their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into its most secret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile Point, they would find new treasures.
The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no want of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which they had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink, which was preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes or beet- roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the "acer saceharinum," a son of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate zones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made a very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren; lastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in food . . . but bread was wanting.
Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent, it was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree among the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these precious trees. However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an infinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his intelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce that which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining of his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights.
On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled in the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at once,--
"Look here, captain--A grain of corn!"
And he showed his companions a grain--a single grain--which from a hole in his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.
The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when at Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a present.
"A grain of corn?" said the engineer quickly.
"Yes, captain; but one, only one!"
"Well, my boy," said Pencroft, laughing, "we're getting on capitally, upon my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?"
"We will make bread of it," replied Cyrus Harding.
"Bread, cakes, tarts!" replied the sailor. "Come, the bread that this grain of corn will make won't choke us very soon!"
Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it, found that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the face-- "Pencroft," he asked quietly, "do you know how many ears one grain of corn can produce?"
"One, I suppose!" replied the sailor, surprised at the question.
"Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?"
"No, upon my word."
"About eighty!" said Cyrus Harding. "Then, if we plant this grain, at the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second will produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred and twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of millions! There is the proportion."
Harding's companions listened without answering. These numbers astonished them. They were exact, however.
"Yes, my friends," continued the engineer, "such are the arithmetical progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication of the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains, compared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to the tobacco- plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In a few years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests their fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth."
But the engineer had not finished his lecture.
"And now, Pencroft," he continued, "do you know how many bushels four hundred thousand millions of grains would make?"
"No," replied the sailor; "but what I do know is, that I am nothing better than a fool!"
"Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty thousand a bushel, Pencroft."
"Three millions!" cried Pencroft.
"Three millions."
"In four years?"
"In four years," replied Cyrus Harding, "and even in two years, if, as I hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year."
At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply otherwise than by a tremendous hurrah.
"So, Herbert," added the engineer, "you have made a discovery of great importance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the condition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you."
"No, captain, no, we shan't forget it," replied Pencroft; "and if ever I find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and sixty thousand, I assure you I won't throw it away! And now, what must we do?"
"We must plant this grain," replied Herbert.
"Yes," added Gideon Spilett, "and with every possible care, for it bears in itself our future harvests."
"Provided it grows!" cried the sailor.
"It will grow," replied Cyrus Harding.
This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this single precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in a pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and confide it to the earth. This was done that very day, and it is needless to add, that every precaution was taken that the experiment might succeed.
The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above Granite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered from the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun. The place was cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms; then a bed of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was surrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth.
Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some edifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only match, and all the anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing was more serious. In fact, the castaways would have been always able to procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply another grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!
从六月份开始，进入冬季了，这时候相当于北半球的十二月，入冬以后，不是狂风就是暴雨，一直没有间歇。有“花岗石宫”的庇护，居民们可以高枕无忧，对这种险恶的天气丝毫不必担心。“石窟”却不同，那里是抵挡不住严寒的侵袭的，并且汹涌的潮水恐怕还会再灌进来。赛勒斯•史密斯已经料到这种可能发生的意外，因此他做了许多防御工作，尽量保护已经在那里安置好的炼铁工具和熔炉。
在整个六月里，他们做了些杂活，没有出去打猎，也没有出去钓鱼，因为食品室里已经储备了很多食物。潘克洛夫闲下来就提议做几个捕兽机，他在这上面寄予极大的希望。不久他就用爬藤做了几个圈套，从此以后，没有一天养兔场不供应一定数量的啮齿动物。纳布几乎整大都忙着腌肉和熏肉，保证大家永远吃到美味的食品。然而居民们除了从气球上落到海岛上来的时候随身所穿的衣服以外，再也没有其他的衣服了。因此他们认真地讨论起穿衣的问题来。原有的衣服固然够暖和，也很结实，他们穿得非常省，甚至他们的衬衣也一点没有坏；可是马上就该换装了。再说，如果到了严寒的冬天，居民们就更要冷得吃不消了。
聪明的史密斯正在这个问题上为难。目前他们已经解决了最迫切的需要：安居下来，储存了大量的食物；可是这么一来，恐怕等不及解决穿衣问题天气就要转冷了。因此他们只好设法在不添衣服的情况下度过第一个冬季。他们上次到富兰克林山去探险的时候，曾经看见摩弗仑羊，以后等到天气转暖，他们就可以经常猎捕它们。一旦有了羊毛，工程师就能够把它们织成既暖和又结实的衣料了……怎么织呢？他在考虑。
“我们就在‘花岗石宫’里象烤肉似的尽量烤我们自己好了，”潘克洛夫说。“反正这里有的是燃料，用不着节省。”
“并且，”吉丁•史佩莱补充道，“林肯岛又不是在纬度很高的地方，这里的冬天大概不会太冷的。赛勒斯，你不是说三十五度相当于北半球的西班牙吗？”
“那当然没有问题，”工程师答道，“可是西班牙的冬天有时候也很冷，冰和雪都不少，林肯岛可能也会冷得那么厉害。不过，这是一个海岛，我想这里的气候会温暖一些的。”
“为什么，史密斯先生？”赫伯特问道。
“因为大海就好比是一个巨大的贮藏器，它把夏天的热都存起来了。一到冬天，它就把热放出来，能保证沿海一带温度适中，比夏天低，可是比普通地方的冬天却要高。”
“这一点我们到时候就可以知道，不必谈了，”潘克洛夫说，“其实我倒不管它冷不冷。有一点是肯定的，现在白天已经短了，夜晚很长。我们谈谈照明的问题吧。”
“那再容易也没有了。”史密斯答道。
“容易谈吗？”水手问道。
“容易解决。”
“我们什么时候开始解决呢？”
“明天，先去打海豹。”
“做蜡烛吗？”
“对了。”
这就是工程师的计划，这个办法完全可以行得通，因为石灰和硫酸是现成的，而小岛上的两栖动物又可以供给他足够制造蜡烛的脂肪。
现在是6月4日。这一天正是圣灵降临节的星期日。大家都同意按照习惯休息一天。所有的工作都停下来了，他们还对天做了祷告，说了些感恩的话。现在林肯岛上的居民已经和当初掉在小岛上的可怜的遇难人大不相同了。他们不再祈求什么——他们只是感谢上苍。第二天，6月5日，天气有些靠不住，但他们还是向小岛出发了。目前他们只能在退潮的时候才可以跨过海峡，因此大家决定要造一只小船，并且要尽量造得好，有了船以后，交通就便利得多了，将来往海岛西南部去进行大规模探险的时候，还能用它沿慈悲河往上游航行，这探险工作，他们决定等到天气好转以后就立刻进行。
海豹的数目很多，猎人利用标枪，毫不费力就刺死了六只。纳布和潘克洛夫就在那里剥皮，单把皮和脂肪带回“花岗石宫”，海豹皮是用来做皮靴的。
打猎的结果得到将近三百磅的脂肪，全部都将用在制造蜡烛上。
制造蜡烛非常简单，即使不能做得十全十美，至少可以非常实用。赛勒斯•史密斯手里只有硫酸，然而把硫酸和中性脂肪一起加热，就可以分离出甘油；然后，他又从这种新的化合物里，用开水很容易地分离出油脂、人造奶油和硬脂来，为了使工序简单化，他用石灰碱化了脂肪。这样他就得到一种石灰质的肥皂，这种肥皂很容易被硫酸分解，硫酸使石灰沉淀为硫酸盐，游离出脂酸来。
在这三种酸——油酸、真珠酸和硬脂酸中，第一种是液体，只要施加足够的压力，就可以排出去；其余两种正是制造蜡烛的原料。
这项工作一共花了不到二十四小时。接着又试验了几次。他们用植物纤维做成蜡烛芯，把它放在熔化的蜡油里，用手捏制，就成为道道地地的油脂蜡烛了，所差的只是颜色不够白和外表不够光滑罢了。蜡烛芯如果在硼酸里浸过，就可以在燃烧的过程中半熔化并且随着蜡油烧尽；自然，现在的蜡烛芯还不能具备这个优点，可是赛勒斯•史密斯做了一把巧妙的烛花剪刀。在“花岗石官”的漫长黄昏里，这些蜡烛无疑将要大大受到欢迎。
这一个月他们在新居里有许多工作要做。这些都是细活，他们把粗糙的工具改得精致了，并且还新添了一些。
居民们首先制造了剪刀，直到现在他们才第一次理发，不过刮脸还不行，但至少可以把胡子剪得短一些。赫伯特没有胡子，纳布虽然有，但也很少，另外三个伙伴却都满脸须毛了，可见剪刀还是十分需要的。
要想做一把小锯子非常麻烦，可是最后终于做成了，只要使用的时候用一些力，就可以把木头锯开。于是他们做了许多桌子、凳子、碗柜，放在主要的房间里，此外还有床架，床上铺着草垫当作被褥。厨房里放着食具架，上面摆着烹调用具，另外还有一个砖炉。整个的厨房显得井井有条。纳布经常勤勤恳恳地工作，好象化学家在实验室里一样。
这些做细活的工人很快就必须变成大木匠了。由于爆炸以后产生了瀑布，必须搭两座桥，一座在眺望岗上，一座在岸上。现在有一道水把高地和岸边分隔开了，必须跨过这道水才能到海岛的北部去。移民们为了避免涉水，就不得不爬到红河的发源地，从那里绕道过去。最简单的解决办法就是在眺望岗和岸边各搭一座长二十到二十五英尺的桥梁。在这项工程里，所需要的全部木工就是伐木，这需要几天的时间。桥梁很快就搭好了，纳布和潘克洛夫过了桥到上次在沙丘附近发现的蛤蜊场去。他们用一辆简单而粗糙的大车代替了原来不便使用的筐子，拉了好几千蛤蜊回来，把它们放在慈悲河口。不久它们就在岩石丛中繁殖起来，形成一片新蛤蜊场。这种软体动物非常好吃，移民们每天都要吃一些。
虽然居民们到现在仅仅探索了林肯岛上的一小部分，但是可以看得出来，这一小部分几乎已经完全可以满足他们的需要了。如果他们深入最隐蔽的地方，到慈悲河与爬虫角之间整个的森林区域去打猎，他们还可能发现新的物产。
居民们只有一样不满足。肉类和菜蔬都不缺少；找来的木质树根经过发酵以后，又可以供给他们一种带酸味的饮料，比凉水的味道好得多；他们不用甘蔗和甜菜，就能炼制糖，所用的原料是“酿母枫”里蒸馏出来的液体，这是枫树的一种，各个温带地区都有，这个海岛上也生长着很多；他们再往饮料里加一些从养兔场采来的香草，就成为非常芬芳可口的茶了，最后，他们还有大量的盐，这是食物中唯一的矿物，……可是却没有面包。
也许不久以后居民们可以找到面包的代用品，这完全是可能的，因为在南部的森林里可以找到西米或面包树，不过直到目前，他们还没有发现这种宝贵的树木。然而在这件事情上，上天不久就直接给他们帮助了。的确，它所赐给他们的东西十分渺小，但赛勒斯•史密斯即使绞尽脑汁，使出全部的智慧，也创造不出来，有一天，当赫伯特补坎肩时，无意之中在夹层里有了发现。
这一天外面下着倾盆大雨，居民们都聚在“花岗石宫”的大厅里，突然少年高声大叫起来：
“瞧啊，史密斯先生，……一粒小麦！”
于是他把一粒麦——独一无二的麦粒——给伙伴们看，它是从坎肩口袋的一个窟窿里掉到夹层里去的。
麦粒的来源可以这样解释：在里士满的时候，有一次潘克洛夫送给赫伯特几只鸽子，麦粒就是当时赫伯特用来喂鸽子的。
“一粒小麦？”工程师马上问道。
“是的，史密斯先生，可是只有一粒！”
“呃，孩子，”潘克洛夫笑道，“我们的日子就此越过越好了啦！嗯！一粒小麦能做什么呢？”
“做面包。”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。
“面包，蛋糕，馅饼！”水手说。“哈，这粒麦做成的面包保证不会把我们噎住的！”
赫伯特觉得这个发现没有多大意义，正打算把麦粒扔掉，可是史密斯把麦粒接过来，仔细看了一下，发现麦粒是完整的，一点也没有损伤，于是就对水手严肃而平静地说道：“潘克洛夫，你知道一粒小麦能结多少穗子吗？”
“我想也就是一个吧！”水手听了这个问题觉得很奇怪。
“十个，潘克洛夫！你还知道一个麦穗能结多少粒麦吗？”
“不，这我可不知道。”
“大概八十粒！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“所以，要是我们把这粒小麦种下去，第一次可以收到八百粒；再把它们种下去，第二次就能有六十四万粒；第三次就有五亿一千二百万粒；第四次就有四千亿粒以上！比例数字就是这样。”
史密斯的伙伴们默默地听着，这些数目使他们惊讶，然而却是实在情况。
“是的，朋友们，”工程师接着说，“这就是一般繁殖的等差级数。可是不要以为小麦每一个穗子结八百颗麦粒就算多了，比起罂粟和烟草来又算得了什么呢？罂粟能结三万二千颗种籽；烟草能结三十六万颗，要是没有种种原因限制它们繁殖，几年之内整个地球就要被这些植物长满了。”
工程师没有继续往下细讲。
“现在，潘克洛夫，”他接着说，“你知道四千亿粒麦合多少蒲式耳吗？”
“不知道，”水手答道，“只知道我是个大傻子！”
“每蒲式耳平均十三万粒，四千亿粒可以合三百万蒲式耳以上，潘克洛夫。”
“三百万！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“三百万。”
“在四年之内吗？”
“在四年之内，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道，“甚至也许只要两年，根据这里的纬度，我想每年是可以收成两次的。”
潘克洛夫还是老脾气，他又禁不住要用大声的欢呼来代替回答了。
“因此，赫伯特，”工程师补充道，“你的发现对我们非常宝贵。每一样东西，朋友们，在我们目前的环境里，每一样东西对我们都是有用的。希望大家不要忘记这一点。”
“不会的，史密斯先生，我们不会忘记的，”潘克洛夫答道；“万一有一天让我找到一粒能结三十六方粒种籽的烟草，我向你保证，决不把它扔掉！现在，我们应该做什么呢？”
“我们把这粒小麦种下去。”赫伯特答道。
“对，”吉丁•史佩莱补充道，“要尽量小心，我们将来的收获全指望它呢。”
“就看它是不是能发芽了！”水手喊道。
“会发芽的。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
这一天是6月20日。播种这唯一的宝贵麦粒正是时候。最初有人提议把它种在盒子里，经过考虑，最后还是决定种在地里，任凭大自然去安排。当天就把它种下去了。不用说，他们关怀得无微不至，一心要使实验成功。
雨过天晴，居民们爬上了“花岗石宫”的高岗。他们在这块高地上选了一处朝阳而又避风的地方。他们打扫了地面，清除了杂草，消灭了昆虫，做成一个土质优良的苗畦，上面撒上一层石灰，畦的四周围上栏杆，麦粒就埋在滋润土壤里。
居民们的这种景况，不是恰恰象在为一所大厦奠定第了一块基石呜？潘克洛夫不禁想起燃点唯－的火柴那天的情景以及当时的焦急心情来了。这一次情况更严重。火要是灭了，遇难的人总可以想一些其他的办法，然而要是不幸遗失了这粒麦，要想再找一粒就不是人力所能办到的了。
Book 1 Chapter 21
From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to visit what he gravely called his "corn-field." And woe to the insects which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.
Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer would certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is considerably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year, was a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but Pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one, which was better.
At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the mouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was frozen.
The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood. Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was an indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel which was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several cartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in the low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had been established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at their different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding had great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite House the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen surface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity, and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to the sea.
About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide extent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for water-birds ought to swarm there.
They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there, and as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied. As an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole colony took part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House, preceded by Top, who bounded before them.
Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered it.
"But," as the engineer justly observed, "that could not take the place of a regular bridge!" So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted in the list of future works.
It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank of the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb coniferae now sprinkled over with snow.
But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth into the open country.
"Ah! I should say those are foxes!" cried Herbert, when he saw the troop rapidly decamping.
They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of barking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped short in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.
The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History. But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert was able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of "Arctic foxes." They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora.
"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft, who only regarded the representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of view.
"No," replied Herbert; "but zoologists have not yet found out if the eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to class them in the genus dog, properly so called."
Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad's reflection, which showed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he found that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were nothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite House, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions against a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one disputed this.
After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by the open sea. It was then eight o'clock in the morning. The sky was very clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk, neither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere too severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more bearable. A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just issuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a Mediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form of a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To the left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point. Certainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would have found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in which no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss. Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the forests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded. The colonists halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of brushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.
While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.
"I believe that we should not have been able to reach it," replied the engineer, "for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we could have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here, nothing but the depths!"
"It is singular enough," remarked Spilett, "that this comparatively small island should present such varied ground. This diversity of aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One would really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea."
"You are right, my dear Spilett," replied Cyrus Harding, "I have also observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this island strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents, and I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly."
"What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?" cried Pencroft.
"Why not?" replied Cyrus Harding. "Why should not Australia, New Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia, as Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a prehistoric period."
"As the Atlantis was formerly," replied Herbert.
"Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed."
"And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?" asked Pencroft.
"It is probable," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that would sufficiently, explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface."
"And the great number of animals which still inhabit it," added Herbert.
"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "and you furnish me with an argument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen, that animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that the species are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to me it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast continent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific."
"Then, some fine day," said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely convinced, "the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia."
"Yes," replied Harding, "there will be new continents which millions and millions of animalculae are building at this moment."
"And what are these masons?" asked Pencroft.
"Coral insects," replied Cyrus Harding. "By constant work they made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the Pacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh a grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of water which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and this limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness and solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently diminished--which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of the earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding to centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn."
"That will take a long time," said Pencroft.
"Nature has time for it," replied the engineer.
"But what would be the use of new continents?" asked Herbert. "It appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is sufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly."
"Nothing uselessly, certainly," replied the engineer, "but this is how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the tropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least to me this explanation appears plausible."
"We are listening, captain," said Herbert.
"This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected. What they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think that it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the sun will experience alter millions of years; others, from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a greater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last hypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly, whatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this cold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than the polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the animals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under the solar influence. An immense emigration will take place. Europe, Central Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of South America. The vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and Africa will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia, and Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest-- will be left to death--to revive some day under superior conditions! But all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.
"My dear Cyrus," replied Spilett, "these theories are prophecies to me, and they will be accomplished some day."
"That is the secret of God," said the engineer.
"All that is well and good," then said Pencroft, who had listened with all his might, "but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has been made by your insects?"
"No," replied Harding; "it is of a purely volcanic origin."
"Then it will disappear some day?"
"That is probable.
"I hope we won't be here then."
"No, don't be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no wish to die here, and hope to get away some time."
"In the meantime," replied Gideon Spilett, "let us establish ourselves here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves."
This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was continued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy region. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which terminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles. The soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable matter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there beds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools sparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling, could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded that the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was really so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would arise, which might produce fevers.
Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water, fluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in flocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily approached.
One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the birds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged to content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the silent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the noise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh. The hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had white bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white, and red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in the capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of the island. The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game. At some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was probable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least brought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within their reach.
About five o'clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn's Fens, and crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.
At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.
从此以后，潘克洛夫没有一天不到他称为“麦田”的那块地方去。要是有什么昆虫胆敢到那里去，那它就该倒楣了！潘克洛夫对它们毫不客气。
将近六月底，一连几天阴雨以后，天气显著地变冷了。29日那天，温度在华氏20度左右（摄氏冰点以下6度67分），第二天是6月30日，相当于北半球的12月31日，这一天是星期五。纳布说这一年的最后一天不吉利，可是潘克洛夫却说这样更好，因为明年的第一天是个好日子。
不管怎么样，年初总是非常寒冷的。慈悲河口已经封冻，不久以后，整个的格兰特湖面也要结冰了。
居民们经常需要补充木材。潘克洛夫很机灵，他乘河水没有封冻的那几天，利用木筏运了大批的木柴回来。河水是一股不知疲倦的动力，他们利用它运送木柴，直到结冰的时候为止。除了从森林里取得大量燃料以外，他们又从富兰克林山的支脉下运了几车煤炭回来。在天冷的时候，能产生高温的煤炭大受欢迎。到7月4日那天，温度只有华氏8度，也就是摄氏零下13度。大家通常是在饭厅里做各种不同工作的，因此在这里又砌了一个火炉。“花岗石宫”里用的水原来是赛勒斯•史密斯从格兰特湖里引来的，现在天虽然冷了，从冰面下把湖水输送过来的水道却始终保持畅通，他对于这一小股流水很满意。为了积贮流来的湖水，还在仓库后面凿了一个蓄水池，池满了，多余的水就通过地下井流到海里去了。
这些天天气非常干燥，移民们决定选一个日子穿足衣服，到慈悲河与爪角之间去探险。那是一片广阔的沼泽，他们认为在那里可以打到上好的野味，因为这种地区可能有很多水禽。
他们估计到那里有八九英里的路程，来回需要一整天的工夫。由于目的地是岛上还没有到过的地区，因此全体移民都参加了这次远征。7月5日早上六点钟，天刚破晓，赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫就拿着标枪、圈套、弓箭，准备着干粮，从“花岗石宫”出发了，托普乱蹦乱跳地在前面领着路。
这时候慈悲河已经结冰了，最近的路是从冰面上过河。
“可是，”工程师说得很对，“这并不能代替正规的桥梁！”因此，搭桥被列为未来的工作之一。
居民们还是第一次踏上慈悲河的右岸，冒险深入高大而美丽的松柏林，这些树上现在都披上了一层雪花。
他们走了还不到半英里，就有一窝在密林里安家的走兽被托普惊动，向空旷的地方窜去了。
“啊！我看象是狐狸！”赫伯特看着这群忙着搬家的动物说。
这是一群狐狸，然而个子非常大，托普在追赶途中听到它们发出一种嗥叫声，吓了一跳，突然站住了，这些跑得极快的动物便乘机逃得无影无踪。
狗是不懂得博物学的，难怪它要吃惊。可是经过这么一叫，这些浑身灰红，黑尾巴梢上长一绺白毛的狐狸，就等于把它的身份暴露出来了。赫伯特毫不犹豫地告诉大家，这种兽的学名叫“白狐”。在智利、福克兰群岛以及美国北纬30度与40度之间的整个区域里都可以看到。使赫伯特感到遗憾的是：这种食肉动物托普竟一只也没有捉住。
“好吃吗。”潘克洛夫问道，他对于海岛上的动物只关心这一点。
“不好吃，”赫伯特说，“可是动物学家们到现在为止还不知道这种狐狸长的是昼眼还是夜眼，也不知道一般把它和狗归到一类是不是正确。”
少年记得很熟，可见他对这门功课非常钻研，史密斯听了以后，不禁微笑起来。至于水手，他一听说这种狐狸不属于“可食类”，就不把它放在心里了。不过他也认为将来在“花岗石宫”附近建立家禽场以后，应该小心一些，以防这些四只脚的强盗去光顾，对这点大家都没有意见。
绕过这一带，居民们发现有很长的一段海滩被海水冲击着。这时候正是早上八点钟，天气非常晴朗，长期的严寒以后，天气往往会这样。他们走了一段路，觉得暖和起来，史密斯和他的伙伴们都已经不感到寒气袭人。并且，由于没有刮风，虽冷也不是那么叫人吃不消。水平线上旭日初升，然而丝毫也没有暖意。海面上风平浪静，一片蔚蓝，和晴天的地中海港湾一样。爪角象一把弯刀，向东南拐去，直到四英里以外的地方，愈到尖端愈细。左边沼泽地带的边缘突然形成一个小尖角，这时候被火一般的阳光照射着。联合湾的这部分没有任何东西可做大海的屏障，连一片沙滩也没有，如果有船只遭到东风的袭击，显然是设法躲避的。这里海面平静，没有浅滩。海水的颜色到处都是一样，没有土黄的色调，连一块礁石也没有；海岸陡峭，根据所看到的这一切，可以断定沿岸一带海水很深，水面以下就是万丈深渊，背后往西四英里的地方，就是远西森林的边缘了。他们可以认为这里是冰雪侵袭下南极岛屿的荒凉海岸。移民们在这里停下来吃早饭，用木柴和晒干的海藻生了一堆火，纳布把冻肉烤成早点，此外还沏了几杯薄荷茶。
他们一面吃，一面瞧着四面八方。林肯岛的这部分非常贫瘠，和整个的西部形成鲜明的对比。通讯记者不禁想起，如果当初掉在这部分海岸上，他们一定想象不出未来的领土是什么样子。
“我相信要是掉在这里，我们是上不了岸的，”工程师说，“这里海水很深，连一块可以攀扶的石头都没有。‘花岗石宫’前面至少有一些沙滩。特别是那个小岛，它大大地增加了我们脱险的可能。这里什么也没有，只有万丈深渊！”
“真奇怪，”史佩莱说，“这么小的海岛，地形居然这样复杂，按理说，这种复杂的地形只有在相当大的陆地上才有。真可以这样说，林肯岛的西部物产富饶，土地肥沃，是由于有墨西哥暖流经过的缘故；而北边和东南地区却好象沿着北冰洋一样。”
“你说得有道理，亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我也注意到这一点了。我觉得这个海岛的地形和自然状况都很特别。它概括了大陆的全部面貌，要说它过去是一块大陆，我一点也不觉得奇怪。”
“什么！太平洋中间有大陆？”潘克洛夫大声说。
“这有什么稀奇？”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。“澳大利亚、新爱尔兰、澳大拉西亚和太平洋里的群岛难道还不能称为世界上的第六大洲吗？难道它不和欧洲、亚洲、非洲以及两个美洲同样重要吗？我认为所有这些大洋里的岛屿都可能是一个大陆的高脊，大陆现在是沉在水里了，可是在人类有史以前，它们是在水面上的。”
“象过去的亚特兰梯斯一样。”赫伯特说。
“是的，孩子……假如真有的话，就是这样的。”
“林肯岛会不会就是那片大陆的一部分呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“可能，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“那就容易说明岛上各种物产都有的原因了。”
“还有遗留下来的大批飞禽走兽。”赫伯特补充说。
“是的，孩子，”工程师说，“你这么一说给我的理论找到根据了。按照视察的结果，岛上有很多动物，这一点可以肯定，更奇怪的是，动物的种类非常多。这是有原因的，我认为林肯岛过去可能是什么大陆的一部分，后来大陆逐渐沉到太平洋底下去了。”
“那么，总有一天，”潘克洛夫说，他好象并不完全相信。“古代剩下的这部分大陆会全部沉下去的，那时候，美洲和亚洲之间就什么陆地也没有了。”
“不，”史密斯说，“将来会有新大陆的，现在有成千上万的微生物正在兴建着。”
“这些泥水匠是什么东西呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“珊瑚虫，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。“它们不断兴建的结果，形成了克列蒙岛和太平洋里其他许多的珊瑚岛。四千七百万个这样的昆虫才只有一厘米重，可是吸收了海里的盐分、消化了水里所存在的固体物质以后，这种微生物就能产生出石灰来，而且这种石灰能在海底构成大块的物质，和花岗石一样的坚硬，一样的结实。过去，在古代初期的时候，大自然利用火积成陆地。现在地壳内部的动力显然是减退了（地面上有许多火山现在都已完全熄灭，这就足以证明这一点），可是有微生物来接替火的职务。我相信一年一年地过去，经过许许多多数都数不清的珊瑚虫的努力积累，太平洋早晚有一天会变成一片大陆，供给我们的后代去居住和开发的。”
“那可需要很长的时间。”潘克洛夫说。
“大自然有的是时间进行这项工作。”工程师说。
“可是要新大陆有什么用呢？”赫伯特问道。“我觉得现在适合人类居住的地方已经足够了，当然，大自然创造出来的东西是不会没有用的。”
“不错，不会没有用的，”工程师答道，“这就是为什么在珊瑚岛所占的热带地区将来一定要有新大陆的原因，至少我认为这样解释是合情合理的。”
“你给我们详细讲讲吧，史密斯先生。”赫伯特说。
“这是我的看法。科学家们一般都认为地球将来是会毁灭的，至少到将来动植物都不能生存了，因为那时候地球上要变得非常寒冷。他们意见分歧的地方只是在于造成这种严寒的原因。有人认为千百万年以后，地球会由于太阳的温度下降而变冷，有人认为是由于地球内部火焰的逐渐熄灭。这种影响会比一般想象的要大，我同意后面这种说法。根据什么呢？譬如：月亮实际上是一颗冷冰冰的星球，虽然太阳永远不偏不倚，一点也不少给它热，然而它上面却不能住人，月亮所以这样冷，那就是因为它内部的火焰——宇宙间所有的星球，包括月亮在内，都是由这种火焰产生的——完全熄灭了。最后，什么原因先不去管它，我们的地球总有一天要冷却的，这种冷却的过程只会逐渐地发生。那么，到那时候会产生什么情况呢？温带地区经过相当时期以后，就要和我们现在的南北极地带一样不能住人了。人类和其他动物都会大批地向赤道地带涌去。那时候会形成大规模的移民。欧洲、中亚细亚、北美洲都会逐渐被放弃，澳大拉西亚和南美洲的南部也是这样，那里的草木也将随着人转移。植物会和动物同时向赤道发展。南美洲的中部和非洲的中部将要成为主要的居住大陆。拉伯兰人和萨摩亚人会发现地中海沿岸的气候和寒带一样。很可能那时候赤道地区会嫌太挤，资源也不够地球上的人类消耗，那有谁能料得到呢，可是自然界是眼光远大的，它现在就在赤道地区打下新大陆的基础，使所有迁来的动植物都不至于没处安身，这不很好吗？这些小昆虫不也可能就是受自然界委托来进行这项工作的吗？所有这些事情我经常想。朋友们，而且我深信我们的地球将来会变得面目全非。新大陆产生以后，大海就要把原有的陆地淹没，在未来的时代里，会有一个象哥伦布那样的人发现琛玻拉索山、喜马拉雅山和勃朗山所形成的岛屿，它们是美洲、亚洲和欧洲下沉以后的遗迹。然后，就要轮到这些新大陆变得不能居住了；热度会逐渐消散，就好象人死了身体慢慢地冷下来似的。那时候地球上的生命就要绝迹了，即使不是永久绝迹，至少也要有一个时期。也许那时候，我们的整个地球都安息了——变得死气沉沉——等到条件转好的时候，再复活过来！可是，朋友们，所有这些都是自然的秘密。我从珊瑚虫的工作谈起，直研究到未来的秘密，也许扯得太远了。”
“亲爱的赛勒斯，”史佩莱答道，“我认为这些理论都是预言，将来会实现的。”
“那是上帝的秘密。”工程师说。
“你们说得都不错，”潘克洛夫聚精会神地听完以后说，“可是你能告诉我吗，史密斯先生，林肯岛是不是你说的那些虫子做的？”
“不，”史密斯答道，“这里纯粹是由火山造成的。”
“那么将来它会消灭吗？”
“可能。”
“但愿那时候我们已经不在这儿了。”
“不，不要担心，潘克洛夫；那时候我们不会在这儿的，因为我们并不想老死在这里，我们还希望早晚有一天要离开这儿呢。”
“不过，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我们还应当象永远住在这里似的建立自己的家园。事情做到一半就泄气不干是不会有结果的。”
话谈到这里就结束了。吃完早饭以后，继续前进，居民们到了沼泽的边缘地带。这片沼泽大约有二十平方英里，一直延伸到海岛东南的圆形海岸，土壤是火山粘土，夹杂着一些腐烂的植物，例如灯芯草、芦苇、野草等的残余。一层厚草象地毯似的铺在沼地各处。不少的水坑都结了冰，在太阳底下闪闪发光。雨水和暴涨的河水都不可能在这里积成池塘。因此他们认为沼地的水分是由土壤里渗透出来的，这是很自然的，而事实上也的确是这样。天热的时候，这里可能有瘴气使人生病。
死水塘里长着一些水生植物，许多飞禽在上面扑着翅膀。野鸭、小凫、鹬都成群地栖居在这里，它们一点都不伯人，人们可以一直走到它们的旁边去。
这些水禽密麻麻地聚集在一起，一枪准能打死好几打。然而探险家们却只好使用弓箭。效果虽然差一些，但也有一个好处，就是没有响声，不致惊动其他飞鸟，如果是枪声，那就要把它们吓得飞往沼地各处去了。这一次猎人满意了，他们打到一打鸭子，这些鸭子身上是白的，上面有一道黄褐色的花纹，头是绿的，翅膀上共有黑、白、红三种颜色，长着扁平的嘴；赫伯特把它们叫做潦凫。在捕捉时托普也出了力。他们就把海岛的这部分叫做潦凫沼地。居民们可以从这里得到大量的水鸟。他们打算以后再来仔细侦察一下，可能发现一些可以驯养的鸟类，如果能把它们赶到湖边去，捉起来就方便得多了。
傍晚五点钟的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们穿过潦凫沼地，渡过慈悲河上的“冰桥”，往回走去。
晚上八点钟，他们回到了“花岗石宫”。
Book 1 Chapter 22
This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however, passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew, the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely. Pencroft regretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of bears rather than of so many foxes and seals.
"Bears," said he, "are generally very well dressed, and I ask no more than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their backs."
"But," replied Neb, laughing, "perhaps the bears would not consent to give you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins."
"We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them," replied Pencroft, in quite an authoritative tone.
But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any rate they had not yet shown themselves.
In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied themselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of the forest.
According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful prize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares would be well received at Granite House.
The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground, a platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and at the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It must be mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but at certain places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds frequented the ground. They were visited every day, and at three different times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic foxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were found in them.
"Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!" cried Pencroft, when for the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at it in great disgust, he added, "beasts which are good for nothing!"
"Yes," said Gideon Spilett, "they are good for something!"
"And what is that?"
"To make bait to attract other creatures!"
The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the foxes carcasses.
The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain plant, and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day passed without some rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not think of complaining.
However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several of those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of the lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable. He could see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe.
"But these are not pigs," said Herbert to him, "I warn you of that, Pencroft."
"My boy," replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one of these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage which served it as a tail. "Let me believe that these are pigs."
"Why?"
"Because that pleases me!"
"Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?"
"I am very fond of pig," replied the sailor, "particularly of its feet, and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!"
As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of the four species which are included in the family, and they were also of the species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence of those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed. These peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they abounded in the woody parts of the island.
At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not ask more from them.
Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose some degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in resolving into snow. All the island was covered with a sheet of white, and showed itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect. The snow fell abundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two feet.
The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite House the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some places, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall whirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base, and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun. However, the storm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island, and the position of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.
But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they remained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August. They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely suffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have the trouble of cutting them down.
"The wind is turning woodman, let it alone," he repeated.
Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.
How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for having prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding had also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature who had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it. There all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them. If they had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights, it certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to the Chimneys, it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea, passing over the islet, would beat furiously against it. But here, in Granite House, in the middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea nor air had any influence, there was nothing to fear.
During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.
There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and little by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the most solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and Pencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they would not have changed on any account.
Then the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly in this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the north, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number of purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut down these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now be effectively employed. The first attempts were somewhat crude, but in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen, by consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by emulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with them, and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes, stone-pine almonds, etc.
During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again. The temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists sallied out directly. There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore, but they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened surface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights.
What a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform color. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore, the forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters of the Mercy flowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the tide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over the frozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were assembled in thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were bristling with icicles. One might have said that the water escaped by a monstrous gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the Renaissance. As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that could not as yet be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was dissipated.
Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of going to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the snow with which they were covered. They had also to be careful not to fall into one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and humiliating; to be taken in their own snares! But happily they avoided this unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact. No animal had fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were very numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed there, which justified the engineer's opinion that dangerous beasts existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally lived in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had ventured as far as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out the inhabitants of Granite House. "Now, what are these feline creatures?" asked Pencroft. "They are tigers," replied Herbert. "I thought those beasts were only found in hot countries?"
"On the new continent," replied the lad, "they are found from Mexico to the Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that tigers are to be met with in it."
"Well, we must look out for them," replied Pencroft.
However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the influence of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white soon vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed their stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup from the maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren, agouties, and kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several excursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees had been blown down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel. They saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely damaged by the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off.
At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite House, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become free, to float down several rafts. They could see that the cold period was not ended.
A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but congratulate themselves on not having been living there during the hurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages. Sweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half filling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks. While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights, and they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as they had been from the first by the heaps of sand.
The store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done with the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of the temperature. It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end of the month of August, which is the February of North America, does not escape this climatic law.
About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted to the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According to the engineer's calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero, and this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale, lasted for several days. The colonists were again shut up in Granite House, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings of the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the consumption of candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern was often only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not spared. Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but they soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder. In consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when they touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants of Granite House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an operation which could be performed indoors.
We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than the liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep incisions in the tree. They contented themselves with collecting this liquor in jars and employing it in this state for different culinary purposes, and the more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to become white and to be of a syrupy consistence.
But there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus Harding announced that they were going to turn into refiners.
"Refiners!" replied Pencroft. "That is rather a warm trade, I think."
"Very warm," answered the engineer.
"Then it will be seasonable!" said the sailor.
This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate manufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this liquor, only an extremely easy operation is required. Placed on the fire in large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and soon a scum arose to its surface. As soon as this began to thicken, Neb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the evaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an empyreumatic flavor.
After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to the operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed into a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously fabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various shapes. The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes and tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly transparent and of a delicious taste.
The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every day they attempted sorties which they could not prolong. They constantly worked at the improvement of their dwelling. They talked while working. Harding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining to them the practical applications of science. The colonists had no library at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always at hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered all their questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus passed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears for the future.
However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the cessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a way to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to the downs or to Tadorn's Fens! Game would have been easily approached, and the chase would certainly have been most productive. But Cyrus Harding considered it of importance that no one should injure his health, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed.
But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this imprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found Granite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from one room to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut up. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark well which communicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back of the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round this hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he tried to put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it. He then yelped in a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and uneasiness.
The engineer observed this maneuver several times.
What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the intelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island? Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well? The engineer did not know what to think, and could not refrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities. Accustomed to go far into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow himself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural; but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs who never waste their time in barking at the moon, should persist in trying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing there to cause his uneasiness? Top's conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even more than he cared to acknowledge to himself.
At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon Spilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top's fancy.
At last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow, hailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice melted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of the Mercy, the forest, again became practicable. This return of spring delighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed it in the hours necessary for eating and sleeping.
They hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to again entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by Cyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be of any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future time, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had become very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals, agouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes, in short, game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows, and that, consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would listen to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till he promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however, supported Pencroft.
"If, which may be doubted," said he, "the island is inhabited by wild beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may come when this will be our first duty."
But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied Harding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed this winter, but they would not last until next winter. Skins of carnivora or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and since there were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the means of forming a flock which might be brought up for the use of the colony. An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the birds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were the two important projects for the fine season.
In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western side. But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this exploration could be profitably undertaken.
They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain.
It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his traps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found three animals which would be very welcome for the larder. They were a female peccary and her two young ones.
Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture, and, as usual, he made a great show of his game.
"Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!" he exclaimed. "And you too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!"
"I shall be very happy," replied the reporter; "but what is it that I am going to eat?"
"Suckling-pig."
"Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!"
"What?" cried Pencroft. "Do you mean to say that you turn up your nose at suckling-pig?'
"No," replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; "provided one doesn't eat too much"
"That's right, that's right," returned the sailor, who was not pleased whenever he heard his chase made light of. "You like to make objections. Seven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only too glad to have met with such game!"
"Well, well," replied the reporter, "man is never perfect, nor contented."
"Now," said Pencroft, "I hope that Neb will distinguish himself. Look here! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old! They will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look after the cooking myself."
And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were soon absorbed in their culinary labors.
They were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared a magnificent repast--the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they had, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries.
At five o'clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House. The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.
To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the guests.
These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring his share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him.
"What's the matter?" asked Cyrus Harding.
"The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!" replied the sailor.
"What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?" said Gideon Spilett.
"I suppose so," replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which had cost him a grinder!--
It was not a pebble--it was a leaden bullet.
严寒一直继续到8月15日，可是并没有比前面说过的华氏温度再低下去。在天气晴朗的时候，温度即使低一些，也还受得了，一旦刮起风来，可怜的居民们由于穿得太少，就要受尽苦楚了。潘克洛夫感到遗憾的是：林肯岛上住着许多狐狸和海豹，却没有一只熊。如果有熊的话，用它们的皮做衣服，多么好呢?
靶埽彼担白苁谴┑檬媸娣模冶鸬囊膊灰幌氚阉撬哪切┡偷亩放窠杓讣垂！?
“可是，”纳布笑道，“也许熊不会答应把自己的斗篷借给你的，潘克洛夫，它们并不是圣•马丁。”
“我们可以使它肯借的，纳布，可以使它肯借的。”潘克洛夫信心十足他说。
然而岛上并没有这种凶猛的食肉动物，至少到目前为止，还没有看见过。
在这期间，赫伯特、潘克洛夫和通讯记者在眺望岗和森林边缘布置着陷阶。
根据水手的看法，任何一种动物，被人猎捕都是合理合法的，不管它是啮齿动物还是食肉动物，只要跑进新做好的圈套里，就应该把它请到“花岗石宫”里来款待一番。
陷阱的构造非常简单，在地上挖好坑，上面蒙上一层树枝和野草，把洞口遮蔽起来，坑底放一些食饵，食饵发出香味，就会把野兽吸引过去了。应该说明，这些陷阱并不是随便乱挖的，而是必须布置在一定的地点，什么地方野兽的脚印多，就说明野兽经常到这一带来。居民们每天都来探看陷阱，在最初几天内，陷阱里一连三次捉住了在慈悲河右岸已经见过的白狐。
“怎么，这里尽是狐狸！”潘克洛夫第三次把一只白狐扔到陷阱外边来的时候说。他非常厌恶地着了它一眼，然后补充道，“这种野兽一点用处也没有！”
“不对，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“它们是有一些用处的！”
“有什么用？”
“拿它做引诱其他动物的食饵！”
通讯记者的意见很对，从此以后，陷阱里的食饵就改用死狐狸了。
水手又用一种树木的长而结实的纤维做了几个圈套，效果甚至比陷阱还要好。每天总要有几只养兔场的兔子来上圈套。捉来的虽然只有兔子一种，然而纳布的烹调花样很多，因此居民们百吃不厌。
在8月份的第二周，猎人们终于有一两次从陷阱里捉到胜过狐狸的东西了，那就是在湖的北边见过的小野猪。潘克洛夫不问也知道这种野兽是好吃的，因为它们很象美洲和欧洲的家猪。
“可是这并不是家猪，”赫伯特对他说，“我要警告你，潘克洛夫。”
“孩子，”水手一面说，一面俯身到陷阱口去，一手揪住短尾巴，提了一只野猪出来，“我还是把它当做猪吧！”
“为什么？”
“我高兴这样！”
“那么，你很喜欢猪吗，潘克洛夫？”
“我很喜欢猪，”水手答道，“特别是猪腿；假如它的腿不是四只，而是八只，那我就加倍地喜欢它！”
野猪科一共有四种，上面所说的这只动物，就是其中的一种，叫做西瑞，特点是颜色根深，没有同类嘴部所生的长牙。西瑞一般都群居的，海岛的森林地带可能很多。
总之，这种动物从头到尾都可以吃，潘克洛夫对它们也提不出别的要求了。
八月将过一半的时候，风向转往西北，气候也突然变了。温度上升了几度，空气里的水汽不久却变成了雪。整个的海岛都覆盖了一层白皑皑的银甲，居民们顿时觉得海岛的面貌焕然一新。一连下了好几天大雪，地上很快就积了两英尺厚。
风也刮得很猛，在巍峨的“花岗石宫”里，可以听见海水撞在礁石上，发出轰隆的响声，地势弯曲的地方，旋风把雪花吹得滴溜溜地转，形成一根根高大的柱子，恰象齐根盘旋的水柱——船只在海里遇到这样的水柱，是要开炮轰击的。暴风雪从西北吹来，横扫海岛，因此“花岗石宫”没有遭到正面的袭击。
可是在这些日子里，风雪怒号，和在某些寒带地区所见到的景况一样可怕。赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们尽管想出去，也只好耐着住子躲在家里，从8月20日到25日，一连困守了五天。他们听见风雪在啄木鸟林里耀武扬威，那里肯定受到了它的蹂躏。一定有许多树木被连根拔起来了，可是潘克洛夫却拿省得他去砍伐来安慰自己。
“风变成樵夫了，让它去刮吧。”他重复着。
事实上，即使他们想要阻止，也是办不到的。
这时候“花岗石宫”里的居民们多么感谢上苍为他们安排了这个铁桶一般的住所啊！他们也向赛勒斯•史密斯表示了应有的谢意，可是这个巨大的石洞毕竟还是自然界造出来的，不过是工程师发现的罢了。暴风雪侵犯不到他们，每个人都很安全。如果用砖头和木料在眺望岗上盖一所房子，肯定地说，是经不住这场风暴的。“石窟”一定完全不能居住了，因为海水漫过小岛以后，就会排山倒海地向它冲去。只有“花岗石宫”坐落在磐石的中心，风吹不到，浪打不着，完全不必担优。
在隐居的这几天里，居民们并没有闲着。
仓库里原来存放着许多木材，他们把木材锯成木板，逐渐就把家具凑齐了。由于不吝惜木料，做成的桌椅都非常结实。纳布和潘克洛夫对这些笨重的家具非常满意，不论谁拿什么东西来，他们也不肯换的。
不久，木工们又学会编篮子了。他们在这项新的工作里，成绩也不错。湖的北部有一处凸出的地方，他们在那里发现一片柳林，生长着许多紫红色的绢柳。在雨季以前，潘克洛夫和赫伯特就把这些有用的灌木砍下来，经过加工以后，枝条就可以有效地利用了，开始试编的时候没有经验，可是由于工人们的聪明和智慧，再经过研究和回想过去见过的篮子的形状，经过互相竞赛，小队里很快就添了几个大小不一的篮子了。他们把篮子放在仓库里，纳布还挑选了几个专门存放他收集来的块茎和南欧松子等等。
8月的最后一个星期，天气又变了。温度下降了一些，暴风雪也平息下来。移民们立刻作了一次旅行。岸边的积雪肯定有二英尺厚，然而地面冻得挺硬，他们走起来倒也并不感到困难。赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们爬上了眺望岗。
多么大的变化啊！森林里的树木，特别是那些主要生长着枞树的地方，上次看见的时候还是一片苍翠，现在什么都没有了，只看见一色白。从富兰克林山山巅直到海边，森林、平原、湖泊、河流连成了白茫茫的一片。慈悲河的河水在冰檐下流过，每当涨潮和落潮的时候，就会把冰胀破，发出很大的响声。封冻的湖面上有无数的飞鸟在振翼飞翔。鸭子和鹬、水鸭和海鸠都成千地聚在一起。岩石丛中流出瀑布的地方倒接着许多冰柱，乍一看以为瀑布是从一个奇形怪状的漏斗里泻出来的，它的样子非常特别，好象是一件文艺复兴时代艺术家的作品。暴风雪在森林里所造成的破坏到底有多大，他们暂时还没法肯定；必须等到表面的冰雪融化以后才能知道。
吉丁•史佩莱、潘克洛夫和赫伯特并没有错过这个机会去看他们的陷阱，陷阱被积雪盖住了，好容易才找到。他们还必须十分小心，以防掉到里面去，要是落在自己布置的陷阱里，那不但危险，而且也太丢脸了！幸而他们没有倒楣，找到了他们原封未动的陷阱。里面没有动物，然而附近却有很多脚印，其中有许多爪印很清楚。赫伯特毫不犹豫地肯定曾经有猫科食肉兽类从这里走过，由此可见工程师说得对，林肯岛上是有凶猛的野兽的。毫无疑问，这些动物一定是住在远西森林里的，因为受饥饿的逼迫，才冒险到眺望岗来。也许它们已经嗅出“花岗石宫”里有人居住了。
“那么，这些猫科食肉兽类是些什么兽呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“是老虎。”赫伯特回答说。
“不是只有热带才有老虎吗？”
“在新大陆上，”少年说，“从墨西哥一直到布宜诺斯艾利斯的判帕草原一带都有。既然林肯岛的纬度和拉巴拉他附近差不多，那么在这里遇到老虎也就并不奇怪了。”
“好吧，我们得提防着它们。”潘克洛夫答道。
由于温度的上升，积雪不久就融化了。经过一场雨以后，大地披的银甲顿时消失得无影无踪。尽管天气很坏，居民们还是照常补充了各种各样的东西，植物方面的有南欧松子、块茎和枫树的糖浆，动物方面的有养兔场的兔子、刺鼠和袋鼠。为了取得这些东西，他们到森林里去了几次，发现有很多树木都被风暴刮倒了。潘克洛夫和纳布还推着大车一直到远处的煤层那里去，运了好几吨燃料回来。路上他们看见烧陶器的土窑遭到大风严重的损坏，至少有六英尺长的一段烟囱被刮掉了。
他们要给“花岗石宫”补充大批的木材和煤炭，正好慈悲河又畅通了，于是他们就利用河水输送了好几木筏的燃料。然而他们可以看得出来，寒冷的季节井没有到头。
居民们也到“石窟”去了一趟，他们在暴风雪的日子里没有住在那里，不能不感到运气。现在留下的迹象可以说明，大海一定在这里显过威风。怒潮漫过小岛，闯进了通道，使里面灌满了泥沙，岩石上布满了一层厚厚的海藻。当纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫去打猎或是砍柴的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱就忙着整顿“石窟”，他们发现炼铁工具和风箱几乎一点也没有损坏，还是和原来用沙子保藏着的时候一样。
贮藏的煤起了很大的作用，居民们有了它才没有受到严寒的威胁。大家都知道，北半球二月主要的特点是温度骤然下降。南半球也是一样，这里的八月底相当于北美洲的二月，也逃不出气候的一般规律。
25日左右，在雪再次变成为雨以后，风向转往东南了，这时候突然变得极度寒冷起来，据工程师估计，温度不会高过华氏零下8度，这次严寒加上刺骨的狂风，更是令人难以忍受，这样一直继续了好几天。移民们二次把自己紧闭在“花岗石宫”里。由于要把上面所有的窟窿都堵严，只留下一条窄缝通风，因此蜡烛的消耗量相当大。为了要节省蜡烛，他们就没有吝惜燃料，常常把烧得很旺的炉火当作石洞里唯一的光源。有时候，也有一两个居民到冰雪——这些冰雪都是由于潮水的一涨一落堆积起来的——包围的海滩上去。可是他们很快就跑回“花岗石宫”来；每当他们用双手握住梯棍向上攀登的时候，他们不但觉得困难，而且感到一阵阵的剧痛。由于严寒的缘故，他们的手指一碰梯棍，就好象燃烧起来似的。为了使“花岗石宫”的居民可以利用自由支配的闲暇，赛勒斯•史密斯选择了一项可以在室内进行的工作。
前面已经说过，居民们吃的糖是枫树的液体。他们把树皮割开一个很深的裂口，让液体流到瓶子里，然后用各种不同方法烹调；经过一定时间，它就开始发白，变成一种很浓的糖浆了。大家对这种东西都感到很满意。
然而，还可以把它做成一种更好的东西。有一天赛勒斯•史密斯告诉伙伴们，他们要当炼糖工人了。
“炼糖工人！”潘克洛夫说。“我认为这个买卖倒不错。”
“是的，很不错。”工程师答道。
“那就合适了！”水手说。
一听“精炼”这个字眼，也许以为需要庞大的工厂、复杂的设备和无数的工人了吧！其实完全不是那么一回事！只要经过一道非常简单的工序，就可以使这种液体成为结晶体了。把糖浆盛在一只巨大的土罐里，在火上熬着，不久表面上就凝了一层碎屑。等这层碎屑逐渐变厚以后，纳布就用一把木刀小心地把它掀起来；这样不但可以加速蒸发，而且还可以避免发焦。
糖浆在旺盛的炉火上熬了几个钟头，不仅熬成了浓缩的蜜糖，而且炼糖工人的身子也暖和了。他们预先在厨房的火炉里制造了一些形状不一的陶土模型，这时候就把蜜糖倒进去。第二天蜜糖冷却了，凝结成许多糖块和糖片。这种糖的颜色微微发红，可是几乎是透明的，味道也很好。
天气一直冷到九月中旬，“花岗石宫”里的“囚徒”们开始感到蹲腻了。几乎每天他们都要想法子突围出去，但是总不能走得恨远。他们不断地改善他们的住宅，一面工作一面谈话。史密斯向他的伙伴们讲了许多事情，主要是向他们讲解科学的实际应用，移民们没有图书馆，可是工程师是一本随时可以参考的百科全书，它老是打开在需要的这一页上，这本书能解决他们所有的问题，他们经常翻阅。时间就这样愉快地度过了，这些勇敢的人好象并不为将来而担忧。
空守在屋内的日子该结束了。人人都在焦急地等待着，即使不盼望美好的季节马上到来，至少也盼望着难以忍受的严寒赶快过去。只要能再多一点衣服，他们的打猎活动就不知道可以进行多少次了，不管是到沙丘也好，到潦凫沼地也好！飞禽走兽是很容易接近的，出去打猎一定可以满载而归。可是赛勒斯•史密斯认为保护大家的健康更要紧，因为人手一个也不能缺，大家都遵照他的意思去做了。
必须说明，最耐不住在房间里困守的，除了潘克洛夫大概就是托普了。这只忠实的狗觉得“花岗石宫”狭小，它从这个房间到那个房间来回乱跑，用种种方法表示关在室内嫌烦闷。史密斯经常注意到，每当托普走近仓库后边通向大海的黑井时，它就奇怪地咆哮起来。井口盖着一个木盖，它绕着井口团团转，有时候甚至把一只爪子伸到盖子底下去，好象要把它掀起来似的。然后它就奇怪地大叫一阵，显得既愤怒又不安。
这种情形工程师看到已经不止一次了。
深渊里究竟有什么东西使这只机灵的畜生忘不了呢？井通向大海是不会错的。可是会不会另外有什么窄道通向海岛的地底呢？会不会与别的小洞相沟通呢？会不会常有海兽到井底来呼吸呢？工程师觉得猜测起来毫无根据，不禁产生了许多荒唐的奇想。他是惯于深入科学的现实领域的，因此不愿意想入非非，更不愿意往迷信方面想，然而托普是一只具有理性的狗，它决不会闲来无事去对着月亮大叫大闹，如果没有原因引起它的不安，它怎么会捕风捉影，坚持要探索这个深渊呢？托普的行动使赛勒斯•史密斯疑惑得不能自信了。
话虽如此，工程师仅仅把他的想法告诉了吉丁•史佩莱，他认为告诉其他的伙伴们也没有用，这些疑团也可能是由于托普的幻觉而产生的。
严寒终于结束了。在这期间也曾经有过雨、风雪、冰雹和狂风，然而这些险恶的天气并没有持续很久。冰雪融化了，海滨、高地、慈悲河的两岸和森林又能够通行了。“花岗石宫”里的居民都为大地回春而感到高兴，再过不久，他们就只有吃饭、睡觉的时候才呆在家里。
九月下旬，他们常常去打猎，这么一来，潘克洛夫又央求着要赛勒斯•史密斯造火器了，他一口咬定史密斯答应过他。工程师很清楚，没有特殊的工具几乎不可能制造一支能用的枪，因此还是没有动手，把这一工作推到将来。他象平时一样淡淡地说，赫伯特和史佩莱已经成了非常熟练的神弓手，许多鲜美的野昧，象刺鼠、袋鼠、水豚、鸽子、鸨、野鸭、鹅，总之，各种飞禽走兽在他们的箭下都休想逃命；因此，他们不妨再等一些日子。然而顽固的水手却不听这一套，他一刻不停地缠着工程师；直到工程师答应满足他的希望时才算完。吉丁•史佩莱对潘克洛夫却是支持的。
“海岛上有没有猛兽现在还不能肯定，”他说，“如果有的话，我们就一定要想法子和它们斗争，把它们消灭掉。迟早有一天这会成为我们的首要任务的。”
可是这时候史密斯所考虑的却不是火器，而是衣服的问题。居民们依靠身上的衣服度过了这个冬天，然而却不能穿到明年冬天。他们必须不借任何代价取得食肉动物的皮或是反刍动物的毛；他们发现过许多摩弗仑羊，于是大家一致同意想法子捉一群来，也许饲养下来可以对小队有用。这就必须先开辟一个养牲畜用的畜栏和一个养鸟类用的家禽场，一句话，要在海岛上建立起饲养场，这是季节好转以后的两件大事。
为了未来的这些工作。他们必须先深入了解林肯岛上所有还没有到过的地方，也就是慈悲河右岸从河口一直绵延到盘蛇半岛尽头的大片密林，以及海岛的西部全境。然而这需要有稳定的天气，要再过一个月才能很好地进行这次远征。
于是他们焦急地等待了一个时期；在这期间突然发生了一件事情，使居民们要探索整个王国的心情更焦急了。
这是10月24日。这一天潘克洛夫去探望他的陷阱。他平时总是把食饵在里面安排得好好的。在一个陷阱里，他发现了三只很适合放在食品室里的动物。那是一只母西瑞和它的两只崽子。
潘克洛夫回“花岗石宫”来了，他捉到这样的野兽觉得非常得意，和往常一样，向大家大肆炫耀了一番。
“来吧，我们可以大吃一顿了，史密斯先生！”他大声说。“还有你，史佩莱先生，也有你一份！”
“我很高兴，”通讯记者答道，“可是你要请我吃什么呢？”
“烤小猪。”
“啊，真的是烤小猪吗，潘克洛夫？听你的口气，我还以为你带回来的是一只塞满松露的小松鸡呢！”
“什么？“潘克洛夫大叫道。“你瞧不起烤小猪吗？”
“不，”吉丁•史佩莱答道，他显得一点也不起劲；“假如不是吃腻了的话……”
“你有理，你有理，”水手回答说，他打来的东西没有受到欢迎，使他很不高兴。“你真难侍候，要是七个月以前刚在岛上登陆的时候让你看见这种野味，你早就要高兴死了！”
“算了，算了，”通讯记者说，“人总是有缺点的，而且也不会满足。”
“现在，”潘克洛夫说，“我希望纳布能拿出他的本事来。你们瞧！这两只小猪还不过三个月！它们简直跟鹌鹑一样嫩！来吧，纳布，来！我要亲自看你烹调。”
于是水手带着纳布到厨房里去了，他们很快就专心地烹调起来。
大家让他们按照自己的主意去烹调。结果纳布做出一顿非常精致的晚餐——两只烤小猪、袋鼠汤、一只熏腿、南欧松子和薄荷茶；的确，他们把最好的食品都拿出来了，然而在所有这些菜肴里，还要数烤小猪最使人满意。
五点钟的时候，晚饭开在“花岗石宫”的餐厅里了。袋鼠汤在桌上冒着热气，他们都认为汤的味道很好。
喝完了汤，接着就是烤小猪了，潘克洛夫坚持要亲自下手分割，他给每个客人都敬了一大块。
烤小猪的确好吃，潘克洛夫狼吞虎咽，正吃得咂咂有声，突然他一声喊叫，接着又骂了一句。
“怎么回事？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
“怎么回事？是这么回事，把我的一颗牙给崩了！”水手答道。
“什么，你的烤小猪里有鹅卵石吗？”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“大概是的。”潘克洛夫一面说，一面从唇边把那件东西拿出来，这是他付出一颗牙齿的代价换来的……
那不是鹅卵石——而是一颗铅弹。
Book 2 Chapter 1
It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the researches they had made, no human being had been discovered. No smoke even had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of the island. No vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late period had man lived there. Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe that it never had been inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent! In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have used such a weapon?
When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked at it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result from this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance, immediately took possession of their minds. The sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled them more completely.
Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions which this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to raise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled it between his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,--
Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than three months old?"
"Not more, captain," replied Pencroft. "It was still sucking its mother when I found it in the trap."
"Well," said the engineer, "that proves that within three months a gun- shot was fired in Lincoln Island."
"And that a bullet," added Gideon Spilett, "wounded, though not mortally, this little animal."
"That is unquestionable," said Cyrus Harding, "and these are the deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was inhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three months. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked? This point can only be cleared up later. As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit the island, or if they have left it, we know not. But these questions are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled."
"No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!" cried the sailor, springing up from the table. "There are no other men than ourselves on Lincoln Island! By my faith! The island isn't large and if it had been inhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before this!"
"In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing," said Herbert.
"But it would be much more astonishing, I should think, observed the reporter, "if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!"
"At least," said Neb seriously, "if Pencroft has not had--"
"Look here, Neb," burst out Pencroft. "Do you think I could have a bullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out? Where could it be hidden?" he asked, opening his mouth to show the two-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished. "Look well, Neb, and if you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a dozen!"
"Neb's supposition is certainly inadmissible," replied Harding, who, notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile. "It is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three months at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed on this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just touched here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of Mount Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we should have been seen ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within only a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of the coast. However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this point settled."
"I think that we should act with caution," said the reporter.
"Such is my advice," replied Cyrus Harding, "for it is to be feared that Malay pirates have landed on the island!"
"Captain," asked the sailor, "would it not be a good plan, before setting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the river, or, if we liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be unprovided."
"Your idea is good, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "but we cannot wait for that. It would take at least a month to build a boat."
"Yes, a real boat," replied the sailor; "but we do not want one for a sea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct a canoe fit to navigate the Mercy."
"Five days," cried Neb, "to build a boat?"
"Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion."
"Of wood?" asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.
"Of wood," replied Pencroft, "of rather of bark. I repeat, captain, that in five days the work will be finished!"
"In five days, then, be it," replied the engineer.
"But till that time we must be very watchful," said Herbert.
"Very watchful indeed, my friends," replied Harding; "and I beg you to confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House."
The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.
So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the settlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was hereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists.
Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about the matter. They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not have some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had been saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them at different times. However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros and cons of the question, ended by saying,--
"In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?"
"Yes, Cyrus."
"Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall find nothing."
The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be well suited for navigating the Mercy--above all, for approaching its source, where the water would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark, fastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of natural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be easily carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means of nails, to insure the canoe being water-tight.
It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong and supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a number of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited for their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had only to be barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed. However, they overcame all difficulties.
While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself without losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.
They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and spear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which may justly be called "the reasoning of bravery." These two companions of the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding's recommendations, did not go beyond a radius of two miles round Granite House; but the borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps was less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota, which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.
Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from it, and one day--it was the 26th of October--he said--"But, Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways have landed on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite House?"
"Very astonishing if they are still here," replied the reporter, "but not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!"
"So you think that these people have already quitted the island?" returned Herbert.
"It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and above all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last betrayed their presence."
"But if they were able to go away," observed the lad, "they could not have been castaways."
"No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the island without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they went away again."
"I must acknowledge one thing," said Herbert, "it is that Captain Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings on our island."
"In short," responded the reporter, "there are only Malays who frequent these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid."
"It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "that some day or other we may find traces of their landing."
"I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would put us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next expedition."
The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among others, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of those superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the name of Kauris.
"I have an idea, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert. "If I were to climb to the top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense distance round."
"The idea is good," replied the reporter; "but could you climb to the top of those giants?"
"I can at least try," replied Herbert.
The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few minutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain of verdure.
From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern portion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End on the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed a great part of the horizon.
But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the yet unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the strangers whose presence they suspected.
The lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not a sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank of trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if deprived of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible to Herbert.
Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood formed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a break or an opening. It was impossible even to follow the course of the Mercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source. Perhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be seen.
But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert's sight could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which would be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?
For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the west, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He strained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No, decidedly there was nothing there.
Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen returned to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad's account, shook his head and said nothing. It was very evident that no decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a complete exploration of the island.
Two days after--the 28th of October--another incident occurred, for which an explanation was again required.
While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House, Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen of the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of the species Midas, the edible green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat.
Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks to reach the sea.
"Help, Neb, help!" he cried.
Neb ran up.
"What a fine animal!" said Neb; "but how are we to catch it?"
"Nothing is easier, Neb," replied Herbert. "We have only to turn the turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and do as I do."
The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and plastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as a rock.
Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back. The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least four hundred pounds.
"Capital!" cried Neb; "this is something which will rejoice friend Pencroft's heart."
In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced, for the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely savory. At this moment the creature's head could be seen, which was small, flat, but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden under the long roof.
"And now, what shall we do with our prize?" said Neb. "We can't drag it to Granite House!"
"Leave it here, since it cannot turn over," replied Herbert, "and we will come back with the cart to fetch it."
"That is the best plan."
However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after which the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach, which the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroft, said nothing about the "superb specimen of a chelonian" which they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb returned with the cart to the place where they had left it. The "superb specimen of a chelonian" was no longer there!
Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them. It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even found the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not being mistaken.
"Well!" said Neb, "these beasts can turn themselves over, then?''
"It appears so," replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all, and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.
"Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!"
"And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this disappearance," thought Herbert.
"Look here," said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, "we won't speak about it."
"On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it," replied Herbert.
And the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned to Granite House.
Arrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working together, Herbert recounted what had happened.
"Oh! the stupids!" cried the sailor, "to have let at least fifty meals escape!"
"But, Pencroft," replied Neb, "it wasn't our fault that the beast got away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!"
"Then you didn't turn it over enough!" returned the obstinate sailor.
"Not enough!" cried Herbert.
And he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.
"It is a miracle, then!" replied Pencroft.
"I thought, captain," said Herbert, "that turtles, once placed on their backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large size?'
"That is true, my boy," replied Cyrus Harding.
"Then how did it manage?"
"At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?" asked the engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this incident.
"Fifteen feet at the most," replied Herbert.
"And the tide was low at the time?"
"Yes, captain."
"Well," replied the engineer, "what the turtle could not do on the sand it might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea."
"Oh! what stupids we were!" cried Neb.
"That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!" returned the sailor.
Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was admissible. But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation? It cannot be said that he was.
气球上的冒险家落在林肯岛上已经整整七个月了。在这期间，虽然他们到处搜索，可是始终不曾发现有人。在荒岛上，甚至从来也没有升起过一缕表示有人的炊烟，也找不到一点人们劳动的遗迹可以证明过去或最近这里曾经有人住过。移民们根据种种事实不得不认为：除了他们自己以外，荒岛上不仅现在找不到其他人，而且从来就不曾有过人。现在，这些复杂的推论都被一颗小小的金属子弹推翻了。这颗子弹是在一只不伤人的啮齿类动物身上找到的！它是从枪里射出来，那是毫无疑问的，可是除了人类以外，谁还会有这样的武器呢？
当潘克洛夫把枪弹放在桌上，他的伙伴们看了以后都感到非常惊讶。尽管枪弹的样子平淡无奇，然而他们却马上联想到这件事情可能产生的一切后果。他们都惊慌得好象白日里见了鬼似的。
赛勒斯•史密斯毫不犹豫地谈出由这件突如其来的怪事使他必然产生的一些联想。他拿起子弹，在手指间翻来复去地转动，然后转身向潘克洛夫问道：
“你能肯定被这颗子弹打伤的西瑞生下来至多不过三个月吗？”
“不会再多了，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫答道。“我在陷阱里发现它的时候，它还在吃奶呢。”
“好吧，”工程师说，“足见三个月之内有人在林肯岛上开过枪。”
“而且打中了这只小动物，虽然没有死，却受伤了。”吉丁•史佩莱补充道。
“这是毫无疑问的，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们应该通过这件事作出这样的推论：在我们到达这里以前，岛上曾经有人住过，要不然就是三个月之内，有人在这儿着过陆。这些人是有目的来的还是偶然来的，是乘船靠岸的还是遇险着陆的呢？这一点只有等将来才能弄明白。至于他们是些什么人：欧洲人还是马来人，敌人还是朋友，我们还没法猜测，他们是不是已经离开了这个岛屿，我们也不知道。可是这些问题非常重要，我们不能等闲视之。”
“不，决不会！万万不会！”水手从桌边跳起来喊道。“林肯岛上除了我们没有旁的人！我敢打赌！这个海岛并不大，假如这里曾经有过人，我们早就发现他们了！”
“要不然那就怪了。”赫伯特说。
“我觉得假如这只西瑞生来肚子里就有一颗子弹的话，”通讯记者发表意见道，“那就更加奇怪了！”
“除非，”纳布严肃地说，“潘克洛夫……”
“你瞧，纳布，”潘克洛夫劈口打断了说。“要是我的下巴颌里有一颗子弹，我还能五六个月找不出来吗？它能藏在哪儿？”他问道，随即张开了嘴，露出三十二个牙齿来。“你好好地看一下，纳布，假如你能找到一个窟窿，我就让你拔下六个牙齿来！”
“纳布的假定自然是站不住脚的，”史密斯说，他虽然满肚子心事，也不由得笑了笑。“我们可以肯定，至多不过三个月，曾经有人在岛上开过枪。我的想法是：这些人是在不久以前才登陆的，也许他们只是路过，因为当我们在富兰克林山山顶上俯瞰全岛的时候，假如这里已经有人的话，我们一定会看见他们的，要不然他们也一定会看见我们。因此这些人可能仅仅是在几星期前才遇难，被风暴吹到海岸上来的。但不管怎么样，应当把这问题弄明白，这对我们是很重要的。”
“我觉得我们应该小心一些。”通讯记者说。
“这正是我要劝告大家的，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“说不定是海盗在岛上登陆了！”
“史密斯先生，”水手问道，“在出发以前，我们先造一只平底船，你认为怎么样？造了船我们既可顺流而上，又可以随意沿海环视全岛。不作准备是不行的。”
“你的意见很好，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道，“不过我们等不及了。造一只船至少要一个月呢。”
“是的，可是那是正规的船呀，”水手回答说，“我们并不需要航海用的船。至多五天，我就可以造一只平底船，保证适合在慈悲河上航行。”
“五天造一只船？”纳布叫道。
“是的，纳布。一种印地安人的船。”
“木头的？”黑人还是不信。
“木头的，”潘克洛夫答道，“说得更确实一些，树皮的。我再说一遍，史密斯先生，五天之内一定完工！”
“五天之内，那么，干吧。”工程师答道。
“可是在这个期间我们一定要非常小心。”赫伯特说。
“的确要非常小心，朋友们，”史密斯回答说，“同时我要求你们，打猎的时候不要离‘花岗石宫”太远。”
他们在紧张严肃的气氛中吃完了午饭，潘克洛夫感到有些扫兴。
居民们得出了这样的结论：荒岛上除了他们自己以外，还有别人居住着，或是曾经有人住过。正如枪弹所说明的那样，这已经成了一件不容怀疑的事实，这个发现不禁使移民们提心吊胆。
赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱临睡以前在这件事情上谈论了很久。他们自己问自己，这件事情和工程师不可思议的得救以及他们许多次碰到的怪事有没有关系呢？赛勒斯•史密斯经过反复考虑，最后说：
“一句话，你愿意听听我的意见吗，亲爱的史佩莱？”
“愿意，赛勒斯。”
“好吧，我的推测是这样：不管我们在岛上搜查得多么仔细，我们也不会发现什么的。”
第二天，潘克洛夫开始工作了。他并不打算造一只有甲板和船舷的船，而只是要造一只适合在慈悲河上通航的简单的平底船——最主要的是，要能通过一般河水较浅的地方，航行到这条河的发源地。只要把一片片的树皮连接起来，就可以成为一只轻便的小船了，假如遇到自然的障碍，必须搬运的话，也不累赘。潘克洛夫打算用钉子把树皮钉起来，这样可以保证平底船决不透水。
为了取得坚韧的树皮来造船，首先必须选择树木。上一次风暴中刮倒了许多高大的桦树，这些树的树皮正好适合他们的需要。有些树倒在地上，只要把它们的皮剥下来就行了，然而这却是最难办的工作，因为他们没有足够的工具。可是他们毕竟克服了重重困难。
水手在工程师的帮助下，一刻不停地工作着。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特也没有闲，他们负责供应全队的食品。通讯记者不得不佩服赫伯特这个孩子，因为他使用弓箭和鱼叉的本领非常高明。此外，赫伯特还表现了非常的勇敢和名副其实的“英明判断”。这两个猎人依照赛勒斯•史密斯的意见，没有离开“花岗石宫”周围二英里远。森林的边缘有大量的刺鼠、水豚、袋鼠、西瑞等等，即使陷阱不如天冷的时候有效，养兔场也还可以供给林肯岛上居民日常食用的需要。
10月26日那天，在打猎途中，赫伯特照例跟吉丁•史佩莱谈起枪弹问题和工程师的推论。他说：
“可是，史佩莱先生，假如遇难的人在岛上登了陆，他们竟会一直没有到‘花岗石宫’附近来，你不觉得奇怪吗？”
“假如他们还在这儿，当然很奇怪，”通讯记者答道，“可是倘若他们已经不在这儿，那就不奇怪了！”
“那么你认为这些人已经离开荒岛了吗？”赫伯特反问了一句。
“很可能是这样的，孩子。假如他们在这里逗留的时间长，尤其是他们还在这儿的话，他们总会暴露行踪的。”
“可是假如他们能够离开这儿，”少年说，“那么他们就不能算作遇难的人了。”
“不错，赫伯特，他们至少是所谓临时的遇难人。很可能是风暴把他们吹到岛上来的，只是他们的船只并没有损坏，因此风暴一过，他们就又走了。”
“我觉得有一点是事实，”赫伯特说，“史密斯先生好象是害怕岛上有人，而不是希望岛上有人。”
“一句话，”通讯记者答道，“常到附近的海上来的只有马来人，而这些人都是恶棍，最好躲开他们。”
“史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说，“也许有一天我们可能发现他们登陆的痕迹吧。”
“那当然，孩子。只要找到一个遗留下来的帐幕，或是一堆灰烬，我们就可以追踪了，这就是我们要在下一次探险中寻找的东西。”
谈话的这天，他们是在慈悲河附近的森林里。这儿的树林特别优美。在一些树木之间，屹立着几棵几乎高达二百英尺的松树，新西兰的土人把这种松树叫做卡利松。
“我有一个主意，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说。“假如爬到一棵卡利松上去，周围的景物就能够看得更远更宽了。”
“主意倒很好，”通讯记者答道，“可是这么高的树，你爬得上去吗？”
“不妨试试看。”赫伯特回答说。
这个行动矫捷的孩子纵身一跳，就上了头几档树枝。由于树枝交叉得当，要攀登这棵卡利松并不团难。几分钟以后，他已经爬到树顶，高居在广阔的绿色平原之上了。
在这个居高临下的地方，他看遍了整个海岛的南方，从东南的爪角直到西南的爬虫角。富兰克林山高耸在海岛的西北，把很大一部分地平线遮住了。
在这巍峨的了望台上，赫伯特可以看见岛上所有还没有勘察过的地方，这些地方都可能成为他们所怀疑的那些陌生人的藏身之处。
少年仔细地观察着。海上什么也没有，不论是水平线上，还是海岛的周围，都看不见船只。可是，有一段海岸被很多树木挡住了，因此也可能有一只船在那里——特别是当它失去桅杆，靠近海岸的时候，赫伯特就更没法看见它了。
远西森林里也看不见有什么东西。树木形成一道无法穿透的屏障，广达好几平方英里，密得连一点空隙都没有。甚至要想顺着慈悲河一直看上去，或是要确定它的源头在深山的哪一部分也不可能。也许还有其他的小河往西流去，可是看不见它们。
退一步说，即使赫伯特把所有的宿营痕迹都忽略了，难道他连一缕轻烟都看不见吗？在明朗的大气里，就是一丝丝极其淡薄的轻烟，也是非常容易觉察到的。
一刹那间，赫伯特仿佛觉得西方有一缕淡薄的轻烟，可是定睛一看，就证明自己看错了。他尽量观看四面八方，他的眼睛是非常敏锐的。但是肯定地说，那儿什么也没有。
赫伯特从卡利松上爬下来，这两个猎人回到“花岗石宫”里来了。赛勒斯•史密斯听了少年的报告以后，摇了一下头，一句话也不说。显然，在彻底搜查全岛以前，还不能给这个问题下结论。
两天之后，10月28日，又发生了一件没法理解的事。
赫伯特和纳布沿着海岸，在离“花岗石宫”大约二英里的地方散步，他们碰巧捉住一只鼍龟目的美丽标本。这是一只米达斯种可以食用的绿海龟，这个名称的由来是因为它的壳和肉都是绿色的。
海龟从乱石堆中向海里爬的时候，被赫伯特看见了。
“帮帮忙，纳布，帮帮忙！”他喊道。
纳布跑了过来。
“多好看的家伙！”纳布说；“可是我们怎么才能捉住它呢？”
“这还不容易？纳布，”赫伯特答道。“只要把它翻过来，它就无论如何也跑不了啦。拿着你的鱼叉，我怎么做，你也怎么做。”
这个爬虫发觉遇到危险，就把头和脚往硬壳和腹甲里一缩，象一块石头似的一动也不动。
赫伯特和纳布把棍子插到海龟身子下面去，两个人一齐使劲，一下子就把它翻了过来。这只长达三英尺的海龟，体重至少有四百斤。
“真好！”纳布喊道；“潘克洛夫瞧见之后一定要高兴死了。”
的确，潘克洛夫一定会从心里高兴的，因为这种海龟吃的是海藻，肉味极其鲜美。这时候，海龟的脑袋露出来了，它的头部有很长的上颚骨，前边又小又扁，从隐藏在上颚骨下的巨大颞窝开始，脑袋就逐渐粗大起来。
“现在，该怎么处理我们的俘虏呢？”纳布说。“我们没法把它拖回‘花岗石宫’去！”
“反正它翻不过身来，就把它留在这儿吧，”赫伯特回答说，“回头我们再驾着大车来把它拉回去。”
“这个主意好极了。”
赫伯特又不厌其烦地在海龟两旁砌上石头，把它夹在当中，以防万一；纳布认为不必多此一举。然后，这两个猎人就沿着退潮以后露出来的海滩回“花岗石宫”去了。赫伯特想使潘克洛夫惊异一下，因此对他们在沙滩上翻倒一只可作为“上等海龟标本”的事，故意一字不提。两个钟头以后，他和纳布驾着大车又回到他们放龟的地方，然而，那只“上等海龟标本”却不见了！
纳布和赫伯特起初面面相觑，然后他们又四处看了一下。不错，海龟就是放在这里的。少年还找到了他用来夹海龟的那些石头，因此他敢肯定没有搞错。
“好吧！”纳布说，“那么，海龟是能自己翻身的了。”
“也许是的。”赫伯特答道，他完全摸不着头脑，呆呆地对着沙滩上的石头发楞。
“潘克洛夫要不高兴了！”
“史密斯先生对于海龟怎么会失踪的，大概也要觉得不好解释了。”赫伯特暗自想道。
“听着，”纳布怕人笑话，打算不再提起，”我们不谈这个。”
“不成，纳布，我们非谈不可。”赫伯特回答说。
大车现在是一点用处也没有了。两个人拉着空车向“花岗石宫”走去。
工程师和水手正在造船工地上干活，赫伯特回来后就把经过情形叙述了一遍。
“唉！傻瓜！”水手喊道，“至少丧失了五十顿饭！”
“可是，潘克洛夫，”纳布答道，“海龟不见了可不能怪我们。我已经说过，我们把它翻过个儿来了！”
“那就是你们翻得不够彻底！”顽固的水手说。
“不够彻底！”赫伯特大声说。
于是他又把怎么小心地用石头把海龟砌在中间的事说了一遍。
“那真奇怪了！”潘克洛夫答道。
“史密斯先生，”赫伯特说，“我认为海龟只要身子仰过来，是绝对爬不起来的，尤其是大海龟，是不是？”
“是的，孩子。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“那它怎么会跑掉的呢？”
“你们把海龟留在离海多远的地方？”工程师问道，他停止了工作，思索着这件事情。
“不到五十英尺。”赫伯特答道。
“当时是低潮吗？”
“是的，史密斯先生。”
“好了，”工程师回答说，“海龟在沙滩上办不到的事，在水里也许是办得到的。涨潮的时候，它能翻过身来，然后它就不慌不忙地回到大海的深处去了。”
“啊，我们真是傻瓜！”纳布大声说。
“不错，刚才我就是这样称呼你们的！”水手回了一句。
赛勒斯•史密斯这样解释当然是合情合理的。可是他自己认为这样解释正确吗？恐怕不见得。
Book 2 Chapter 2
On the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft had kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in five days. A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a scull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet long, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of launching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated it. Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and declared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to put it.
"Hurrah!" cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own triumph. "With this we could go round--"
"The world?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"No, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well, captain--and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb--aren't you coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will carry all five of us!"
This was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following the shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south ended.
As they embarked, Neb cried,--
"But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft."
"That's nothing, Neb," replied the sailor; "the wood will get seasoned. In two days there won't be a single leak, and our boat will have no more water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!"
They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.
Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in the stern in order to use the scull.
The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern point of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was found either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the surface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the shore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.
Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat then skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all Tadorn's Fens.
This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved to go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary to take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.
The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks which fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff gradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was formed of granite reeks, capriciously distributed, very different from the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out there. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected two miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant's arm stretched out from a leafy sleeve.
The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the coast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.
As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining some strange country.
In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the canoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to return, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,--
"What do I see down there on the beach?"
All eyes turned towards the point indicated.
"Why," said the reporter, "there is something. It looks like part of a wreck half buried in the sand."
"Ah!" cried Pencroft, "I see what it is!"
"What?" asked Neb.
"Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full," replied the sailor.
"Pull to the shore, Pencroft!" said Cyrus.
A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its passengers leaped on shore.
Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.
"There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island," said Herbert.
"Evidently," replied Spilett.
"But what's in this chest?" cried Pencroft, with very natural impatience. "What's in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it with! Well, perhaps a stone--"
And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.
"Pencroft," said he, "can you restrain your impatience for one hour only?"
But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in there!"
"We shall find that out, Pencroft," replied the engineer; "but trust to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must convey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without breaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated here, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river."
"You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual," replied the sailor.
The engineer's advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest, which doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up. It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite House.
And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question. Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and examined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or pieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock to survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight--neither a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail.
However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had landed on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there? But the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of American or European make.
All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large size. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it had stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt whatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the water, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did not appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured.
It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this floating apparatus.
"We will tow this chest to Granite House," said the engineer, "where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it belongs. If we find no one--"
"We will keep it for ourselves!" cried Pencroft. "But what in the world can there be in it?"
The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.
The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep it above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not realized, and an hour and a half after they set out--all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three miles--the boat touched the beach below Granite House.
Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was then going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home, brought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that it might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.
The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be sheltered from damp.
"Oh!" cried Neb, "suppose it's jam!
"I hope not," replied the reporter.
"If only there was--" said the sailor in a low voice.
"What?" asked Neb, who overheard him.
"Nothing!"
The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were produced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and down. There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking utensils which Neb covered with kisses!
In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this is the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett's note-book:
--Tools:--3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen's axes, 2 carpenter's hatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.
Weapons:--2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.
Instruments:--1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of mathematical instruments, 1 mariner's compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.
Clothes:-2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.
Utensils:-1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives,
Books:-1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of white paper, 2 books with blank pages.
"It must be allowed," said the reporter, after the inventory had been made, "that the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, utensils, books--nothing is wanting! It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it beforehand."
"Nothing is wanting, indeed," murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.
"And for a certainty," added Herbert, "the vessel which carried this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!"
"Unless," said Pencroft, "the owner had been taken prisoner by pirates--"
"That is not admissible," replied the reporter. "It is more probable that an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter, and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared this chest and threw it overboard."
"Is that your opinion, captain?" asked Herbert.
"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "that may have been the case. It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they collected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in hopes of finding it again on the coast--"
"Even the photographic box!" exclaimed the sailor incredulously.
"As to that apparatus," replied Harding, "I do not quite see the use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!"
"But isn't there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?" asked Gideon Spilett.
That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined, especially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste.
As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both were English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the date of publication.
The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a typographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.
The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in the world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator's projection, and of which the nomenclature was in French--but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher.
There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which they could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.
But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the settlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to their intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not appear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these productions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.
However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It appeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently held in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom of the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was heard to mutter these words:--"That's all very fine, but you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!"
This led Neb to say,--
"Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?"
"Half a pound of tobacco," replied Pencroft seriously, "and nothing would have been wanting to complete my happiness!"
No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor's.
But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways had landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without resources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them without delay.
During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House, where they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day--the 29th of October--happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the Gospel.
"Willingly," replied Cyrus Harding.
He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft stopped him, saying,--"Captain, I am superstitious. Open at random and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it applies to our situation."
Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor's idea, and, yielding to his wish, he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.
Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:--
"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth."
10月29日，树皮平底船完工了。潘克洛夫按照自己的保证，在五天之内，造成一艘轻舟，船身是用“克来金巴”树的柔韧细枝编成的。这只小船共有三个座位，一个在船尾，一个在中间，用来保持船身的平衡，一个在船头。此外还有两个桨架和一个掌握方向的尾橹。全长十二英尺，重量不到二百斤。
想让它下水是极其简单的。平底船被带到海滨来，放在“花岗石宫”前面的沙滩上，潮水一涨，它就浮起来了。潘克洛夫马上跳上船去一面摇起橹来，一面夸奖这只船，说对大家再适合也没有了。
“哈哈！”水手喊道，他不能不为自己的胜利而感到高兴。“我们可以用它周游……”
“全世界？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“不，全海岛。再找一些压仓的石头。竖一根桅杆，过几天史密斯先生再给我们做一面帆，我们就可以耀武扬威地出航了！史密斯先生，还有你，史佩莱先生，还有你，赫伯特，还有你，纳布，你们要来试试我们的新船吗？来呀！看看它能不能把我们五个人都载起来！”
这的确有一试的必要。潘克洛夫马上通过一条岩石间的水道，把平底船摇到岸边来。他们商量妥，当天沿着海岸一直划到第一个海角，也就是南部岩石的尽头，作一次试航。
他们上船时，纳布喊道：
“你的船有点漏水呢，潘克洛夫。”
“不要紧，纳布，”水手答道；“木头自己就会密合的。两天之内，连一条缝都不会有，那时候，我们船里的水就要比醉鬼胃里的水还要少了。跳进来！”
他们马上都坐下来，潘克洛夫荡开了桨。天气很好，海面上风平浪静，简直和湖水一样。因此航行中非常安全，好象在平静的慈悲河上逆流而上似的。
纳布掌着一支桨，赫伯特掌着另外一支，潘克洛夫坐在船尾摇橹。
水手首先穿过海峡，把船摇到小岛的南端。一阵微风从南面吹来。不论在海峡里还是在碧绿的大海上，都没有翻腾的巨浪。海面上滚动着长长波条，但是由于船载很重，船上的人几乎没有丝毫感觉。他们划到离岸约有一英里半的地方，打算好好地看一下富兰克林山。
看完以后，潘克洛夫又回到河口。平底船接着就沿岸航行，海岸一直伸向尽头的海角，把整个的潦凫沼地都遮住了
这个海角离慈悲河将近三英里，由于海岸线十分曲折，因此距离才有这么远，他们决定划到尽头去，必要的时候，还要更远一些，以便大概地观察一下直到爪角一带的海滨。
平底船绕过潮水开始淹没的礁石，沿着曲折的海岸航行。峭壁由河口逐渐向海角倾斜下来。它是由花岗石形成的，东一堆西一堆零乱地散布着，和眺望岗的峭壁完全不同，而且看起来非常荒凉，好象曾有人在这里开采过大量山石似的。从森林里向外突出的这段长达二英里的陡峭的海角，没有任何植物，看起来好象一只从枝叶茂密的衣袖里伸出来的巨大手臂。
平底船在双桨的推动下，顺利地前进着。吉丁•史佩莱一手握着铅笔，一手拿着笔记本，把海岸的轮廓鲜明地画了下来。纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫一面聊天，一面观察他们的这部分新领土；随着平底船向南前进，颚骨角的南北两个部分也好象移动起来，把联合湾包围得更紧了。
赛勒斯•史密斯一句话也不说，他只是凝神看着，他的目光有些疑虑，好象在观察一个陌生的地方。
平底船前进了三刻钟以后，到达了海角的顶点。潘克洛夫正打算掉转船头，赫伯特突然站起身来，指着一件黑色的东西说：
“那边海岸上有个什么东西？”
大家都朝着他所指的方向看去。
“怎么，”通讯记者说，“的确有东西。象是一只破船的残骸，一半陷在泥沙里。”
“啊！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我明白了！”
“什么？”纳布问道。
“木桶，木桶，也许还满装着东西呢。”水手回答说。
“靠岸，潘克洛夫！”赛勒斯说。
他们划了几桨，平底船就进入一条小河，船上的人跳上岸去。
潘克洛夫没有猜错。那儿有两只木桶，半埋在沙里，可是，还紧紧地绑着一只大箱子。这只箱子由木桶浮力支持着，起初在水面飘浮，后来就搁在海滩上了。
“那么，在荒岛上有过遇难的船了。”赫伯特说。
“很明显。”史佩莱答道。
“可是箱子里是什么？”潘克洛夫忍不住问道。“箱子里是什么？锁着呢，没关系，把它砸开！好吧，用石头……”
水手举起一块沉重的石头，正打算把箱子的一面砸破，可是工程师抓住了他的手。
“潘克洛夫，”他说，“你能再忍耐一个钟头吗？”
“史密斯先生，你想，也许这里面有我们所需要的东西呢！”
“我们会拿出来的，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“可是交给我，不要把箱子毁了，我们可能用得着它。我们应该把它带回‘花岗石宫’去，到了那儿不必打坏，很容易就可以打开了。这个箱子带起来也不费事，既然它已经漂到这儿来，不妨再让它漂到河口去。”
“说得对，史密斯先生，我又错了，不过人有时总不能克制自己。”水手说。
工程师的意见很正确。的确，这只箱子既然需要两只空桶把它浮起来，无疑是很沉重的，把箱子里所盛的东西全装到平底船上去恐怕会载不动。因此，最好还是在水面上把它拉到“花岗石宫”前面的海滩去。
这只箱子是从哪里来的呢？这是一个重要的问题。赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们留神地察看了一下周围，又视察了一下几百步以外的海岸，再也找不到难船的其他遗物了。赫伯特和纳布爬上一块高耸的山石去俯瞰大海，也没有瞧见什么——既没有折断桅杆的孤舟，也没有扬帆行驶的船只。
可是曾经有船遇险这一点是肯定的了。也许这也和枪弹事件有关吧？也许有一些人在荒岛的其他地方登了陆。也许他们还在这儿。他们都自然而然地想到一点，那就是：这些陌生人不可能是海盗，因为这只箱子一看就知道是欧美制造的。
大家都围拢到这只大得出奇的箱子旁边来。箱子是橡木的，关得很严，外面包着一张很厚的兽皮，用铜钉子钉在上面。两只巨大的木桶密封着，敲上去发出空洞的声音。这两只木桶被绳子牢牢地缚在箱子的两边，绳结非常巧妙，潘克洛夫一看见就说，只有水手才系得出这样的结来；箱子看起来丝毫没有损坏，只要看它搁在沙滩上，而不是撞在乱石堆中，就足以说明这一点了。经过仔细观察以后，他们都一致肯定：箱子在水里的时间还不久，甚至是最近才上岸的。海水好象还没有透到里面去，箱内的东西自然还没有损坏。
显然，有一只折断桅杆的船在荒岛附近漂浮时，把这只箱子扔了出来，船上的人希望箱子能到达陆地，以便事后找回来，因此才用这一套办法小心地把它浮起来的。
“我们把箱子从水上拖回‘花岗石宫’去，”工程师说，“到了那儿我们就可以清点一下里面的东西了。以后，要是找到在假设的遇难中逃出性命的人，我们就把箱子还给他们。要是找不着……”
“就算是我们的了！”潘克洛夫大声说。“可是，里面究竟有些什么呢！”
海水已经迫近箱子，上涨的海潮显然就要把它浮起来了。他们解开一根绳子把这套漂浮的设备拴在平底船的后边。然后潘克洛夫和纳布就用他们的桨挖开泥沙，使箱子移动起来更方便些，平底船拖着箱子，马上就绕过了遗物角——这个因遗留箱子而得名的地方。
箱子很重，空桶勉强把它维持在水面上。水手时刻都担心箱子会脱扣而沉到海底去，幸亏他的顾虑没有成为事实。他们启程以后一个半小时——这个时间内航行了三英里——就在“花岗石宫”下面靠岸了。
于是，他们把平底船和箱子都拖上沙滩。这时候正赶上退潮，他们很快就高居在没有水的海滩上了。纳布急忙跑回家去，拿来几件应用的工具，好使箱子打开而一点不受损伤，然后他们就准备清点东西。潘克洛夫显得兴高采烈。
水手开始动手把两个木桶卸下来，木桶很完整，还可以用。随后他用凿子和锤子去打锁。盖子打开了。箱子的内壁衬着一层锌皮，这显然是为了防止箱中的物件受潮。
“啊！”纳布大声喊道，“也许是罐头！”
“但愿不是。”通讯记者说。
“假如是……”水手低声说。
“什么？”纳布无意中听见了，问道。
“没有什么！”
水手扯开锌皮，把它扔在箱子上，然后就把各种各样的东西逐件拿出来，放在沙滩上。每拿出一样新的东西，潘克洛夫都要欢呼几声，赫伯特拍着手，纳布在一旁手舞足蹈——象黑人跳舞似的。赫伯特发现有书，不禁喜出望外；纳布拿着烹调器具不住接吻。
总之，他们感到心满意足是理所当然的，因为箱子里工具、武器、仪器、衣服、书籍都有；下面就是一张吉丁•史佩莱记在笔记本上的一张全部物品的清单：
工具——三把多开的小刀，两把砍柴斧，两把木工斧，三个刨子，两个锛子，一把鹤嘴锄，六把凿子，两把锉，三把锤子，三把螺丝起，两把钻孔锥，十袋洋钉和螺丝钉，三把大小不同的锯子，二十二匣针。
武器——两支燧发枪，两支撞针枪，两支后膛马枪，五把尖刀，四把马刀，两桶火药（每桶二十五斤），十二箱雷管。
仪器——一个六分仪，一副双筒望远镜，一架长筒望远镜，一匣绘图仪器，一个航海指南针，一只华氏寒暑表，一只无液晴雨表，一只装有照相器材、对物透镜、感光板、药品等的匣子。
衣服——两打衬衫（由一种类似羊毛的织物制成，但显然是植物纤维），三打长袜（也是同样的质料）。
器皿——一只铁汤罐，六把带柄小铜锅，三只铁盘，十只钢精羹匙和十只钢精叉子，两把水壶，一个轻便火炉，六把餐刀。
书籍——一本《圣经》（《新旧约全书》），一本地图，一本《玻里尼西亚成语辞典》，一部《自然科学辞典》（共包括六本），三令白纸，两本白纸簿子。
“必须承认，”通讯记者在清点完毕以后说，“这个箱子的主人是一个经验丰富的人！工具、武器、仪器、衣服、器皿、书籍……什么都有了！他简直是料到要遇险，困此事先做好了准备。”
“真是什么都有。”赛勒斯•史密斯若有所思地说。
“可以肯定，”赫伯特补充道，“这只箱子和它主人的船不是海盗的！”
潘克洛夫说：“除非箱子的主人被海盗俘虏了……”
“这是不可能的，”通讯记者答道。“大概是一只欧美的船只被风暴吹到这里来，乘客们打算最低限度把必需品保留下来，因此才准备了这个箱子，把它扔在海里的。”
“你同意这样的看法吗，史密斯先生？”赫伯特说。
“是的，孩子，”工程师答道，“大概是这样。遇险的时候，或者是知道要遇险的时候，他们可能把各种最有用的东西都收集在一起，放在箱子里，希望事后再在海岸上找到它……”
“难道连照相器材的匣子都要收起来？”水手怀疑地喊道。
“至于照相器材，”史密斯答道，“我还不太明白留着干什么，要是多放一些衣服或是火药对我们以及任何遇难人都要宝贵得多！”
“这些仪器、工具和书籍上有没有记号和线索可以知道它们的来历呢？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
这是可以证实的。所有的东西，特别是书籍、用具和武器，都经过仔细的检查。可是这些武器和仪器都跟一般的不同，没有制造厂的牌号。而且，它们简直跟新的一样，看来好象根本没有用过，工具和器皿也有着同样的特点；一切都是新的。这一点说明这些东西不是随便扔到箱子里，相反，是经过慎重考虑，挑选出来的。此外，还有一件事也足以说明这一点，那就是：这些东西有锌皮保护着防潮，如果在慌忙之中，进行金属焊接是不可能的。
《自然科学辞典》和《玻里尼西亚成语辞典》都是英文的，可是上面既没有出版者的名字，又没有出版日期。
那本四开本的英文《圣经》也是一样，它印刷得非常特殊，而且一看就知道是经常使用的。
那本地图是一件非常精致的作品，它包括世界各国的分图和几幅根据墨卡托投影法制成的地球平面图，专门术语都是法文的——可是也没有出版日期和出版者的名字。
因此，在这许多不同的东西上，他们发现不出丝毫线索。这艘船最近曾在附近沿海航行过，这是可以肯定的，但要想进一步知道它属于哪一国，却没有任何东西可以说明。
不管这只箱子是从哪儿来的，它毕竟是使林肯岛上的居民增加了财富。在这以前，他们已经利用自然产物，给自己创造了一切，同时由于他们的智慧，使他们战胜了困难。可是，现在凭空有了这些工业品，好象是上苍有意报偿他们似的，因此他们都一致感谢上苍。
他们之间有一个人却还不满足，那就是潘克洛夫。箱子里好象还少一样他特别重视的东西；当他们翻到箱底的时候，他的欢呼也就渐渐地不如原先热烈了，清点完毕以后，只听见他喃喃地说：
“都不错，可是你们瞧，箱子里却没有我想要的东西！”
纳布听了以后说：
“怎么，潘克洛夫，你还想要什么？”
“半斤烟草，”潘克洛夫严肃地答道，“有了这个我就完全满足了！”
听了水手的话以后，谁都忍不住笑出声来。
发现了箱子，大家感觉到现在更有必要彻底搜查全岛了。他们一致同意第二天早上天一亮就出发，沿着慈悲河向上游航行，直到西海岸。应该考虑到，假如有遇难的人上陆，他们可能没有生活资料，因此必须毫不迟延地去帮助他们。
天黑以前，他们把各种物品都搬进了“花岗石宫”，井井有条地放在大厅里。
10月29日这一天是星期日，在临睡以前，赫伯特要求工程师给大家念一段福音。
“好。”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说。
他拿起《圣经》，正打算翻开，潘克洛夫拦住他说：
“史密斯先生，我有些迷信，你随便翻开一页，把首先看见的那一行念出来，看看和我们的遭遇是不是相合。”
赛勒斯•史密斯听了水手的话以后，微微一笑，他果然按照水手的意思随手一翻，恰好这一页夹着一个书签。
他马上注意到，在《马太福音》第七章第八节的附近有一个铅笔画的红十字。他把那一行念了出来：
“凡祈求的，就得着。寻找的，就寻见。”
Book 2 Chapter 3
The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary. In fact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to others.
It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as the river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be traversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the island.
It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take with them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring back to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was supposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully their prizes. In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use than the light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not contained, besides "his halfpound of tobacco," a pair of strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!
The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store of meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain them for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition. They hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove.
The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen's axes, which they could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.
For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely to be more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first only requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges. As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast forest with some chance of success.
It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were at the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them promise not to fire a shot unless it was necessary.
At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had embarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.
The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours, therefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for later the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was already strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary to increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the explorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the place where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of wood.
After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of great evergreen firs.
The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his companions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced by nature with water and trees. As they advanced the forest element diminished. On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which withstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups belonging to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes excellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black, crossed with capricious veins.
From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the canoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their guns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without expecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach, belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be possible to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish, turnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than three feet high, which produced brownish grains.
Do you know what this plant is?" asked Herbert of the sailor.
"Tobacco!" cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite plant except in the bowl of his pipe.
"No, Pencroft," replied Herbert; "this is not tobacco, it is mustard."
"Mustard be hanged!" returned the sailor; "but if by chance you happen to come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don't scorn that!"
"We shall find it some day!" said Gideon Spilett.
"Well!" exclaimed Pencroft, "when that day comes, I do not know what more will be wanting in our island!"
These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.
The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of the Mercy.
The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the river from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and nearly straight for a length of about three miles. But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the Mercy continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the river rose.
During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold of two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it was resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future poultry-yard.
But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance of a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher.
"I recognize him!" cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off by itself.
"What do you recognize?" asked the reporter.
"The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we gave the name to that part of the forest."
"A jacamar!" cried Herbert.
It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic luster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory is of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of the wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy belonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories are better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough, but it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the king of eatable birds. It was ten o'clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth. Here a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees. The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth, and its bed from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable, being simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood, as well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye could reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under the trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed. The explorers could not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident that the woodman's axe had never touched these trees, that the pioneer's knife had never severed the creepers hanging from one trunk to another in the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass. If castaways had landed on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it was not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should be sought.
The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western coast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according to his estimation.
The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards the shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they should use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel to float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes. But soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going down, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this distance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of the oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull. The forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite isolated. But the further they were from each other the more magnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which circulated around them.
What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly their presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without hesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.
"Eucalypti!" cried Herbert.
They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the extratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand eucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a network of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more wonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that the sun's rays penetrate more freely among the trees.
The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and from the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the sunlight like winged rubies.
"These are something like trees!" cried Neb; "but are they good for anything?"
"Pooh!" replied Pencroft. "Of course there are vegetable giants as well as human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at fairs!"
"I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft," replied Gideon Spilett, "and that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously employed in cabinet-making."
"And I may add," said Herbert, "that the eucalyptus belongs to a family which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the pomegranate- tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora, the fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and thirteen hundred species!"
The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical lecture with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and Pencroft with an indescribable feeling of pride.
"Very good, Herbert," replied Pencroft, "but I could swear that all those useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them giants like these!"
"That is true, Pencroft."
"That supports what I said," returned the sailor, "namely, that these giants are good for nothing!"
"There you are wrong, Pencroft," said the engineer; "these gigantic eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something."
"And what is that?"
"To render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what they are called in Australia and New Zealand?"
"No, captain."
"They are called 'fever trees.'"
"Because they give fevers?"
"No, because they prevent them!"
"Good. I must note that," said the reporter.
"Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote has been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the north of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No more intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests of the myrtaceae. This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy circumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island."
"Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!" cried Pencroft. "I tell you, it wants nothing--unless it is--"
"That will come, Pencroft, that will be found," replied the engineer; "but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry our boat!"
The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods of this portion of the island. The space which they occupied extended as far as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along between high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds, and even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult. The action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push with a pole. They found also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already sinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the ground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and this distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods.
The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became thicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of these animals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the settlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first time, they had not yet learned to fear them. It would have been easy to bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was greatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre. This was prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary aggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the explorers' firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the sailor considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those animals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they had an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their ammunition.
Towards four o'clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly difficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks. The banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the spurs of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off, since it was fed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.
"In a quarter of an hour," said the sailor, "we shall be obliged to stop, captain."
"Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for the night."
"At what distance are we from Granite House?" asked Herbert.
"About seven miles," replied the engineer, "taking into calculation, however, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the northwest."
"Shall we go on?" asked the reporter.
"Yes, as long as we can," replied Cyrus Harding. "To-morrow, at break of day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the distance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the whole day in which to explore the shore."
"Go ahead!" replied Pencroft.
But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was now not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower overhead, and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the noise of a waterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier.
Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through the trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it was moored to a trunk near the right bank.
It was nearly five o'clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source. The different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river further down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.
It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists disembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among the branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was necessary, take refuge for the night.
Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious nature had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for the night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb and Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought they saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of October, at five o'clock in the morning, all were on foot, ready for a start.
第二天，10月30日，大家都为参加预定的探险作好了准备。最近的许多事情使这次探险变得非常必要。的确，现在情况不同了，林肯岛上的居民不但可以不需要别人帮助，而且能够帮助别人了。
因此大家一致的意见是：只要能够走得通，就尽可能地往慈悲河上游驶去。这样探险队就可以毫不费力地走完相当长的一段距离，同时还可以把他们的粮食和武器运到荒岛的西面去。
现在除了要考虑带去的东西以外，还必须考虑到他们可能带一批东西回来。假如真和想象中的一样，海滩上曾经有船遇险的话，那么就会有很多被遗留下来的东西，这些东西，他们是可以合法占有的。在这种情况下，大车就要比轻便的平底船有用得多了。可是大车过于笨重，拉起来很不方便，于是潘克洛夫又感到遗憾了，以前是认为箱子里没给他预备“半斤烟草”，现在则认为箱子里缺少两匹新泽西的壮马，因为这对探险队说来，是非常有用的：
纳布已经把粮食包装起来了，其中包括大量肉类和好几加仑的啤酒，这些东西足够他们吃三天——也就是史密斯所规定的探险期限。此外，他们还打算一路上补充，纳布没有忘记携带轻便火炉。
他们所带的工具只有两把砍柴斧，在路过密林的时候，可以用来开路；仪器方面，带了一副望远镜和一个袖珍指南针。
至于武器，他们选择了两支燧发枪，因为他们认为带燧发枪比撞针枪更合适些。燧发枪需要的火石很容易补充，而撞针枪却必须用雷管，如果经常使用，他们有限的贮存就要用完了。可是他们也带了一支马枪和一些弹药。至于火药，桶里大约共有五十斤，他们必须稍微带一些，但是工程师打算自己制造一种炸药，这样他们就可以把火药节省下来。除了火器之外，他们又带了五把妥藏在皮鞘里的尖刀。有了这样的装备，难怪居民们可以怀着成功的希望，到大森林里去冒险了。
不用说，潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布有了这样的装备，自然是十分满意；当然，赛勒斯•史密斯叫他们提出保证，非不得已不随意乱放一枪。
早上六点钟，平底船离岸了；包括托普在内，全体都上了船，他们开始向慈悲河口驶去。
半个钟头以前就涨潮了。潮水将要往里流几小时，这对航行是有利的，等到退潮的时候，逆流而上，就会增加一些困难。三天之内月亮就要圆了，潮势已经很猛，足够把船身保持在潮流的中心，使它漂浮着在高耸的两岸之间迅速前进，而不需要用双桨来增加它的速度。几分钟以后，探险家们就来到慈悲河的一个拐角处。七个月以前，潘克洛夫就是在这儿制造第一只木筏的。
过了这个突出的拐角以后，河面开阔多了，船从高大的常绿枞树浓荫下驶过。
慈悲河两岸的景色非常秀丽。大自然用河水和树木随意安排的美景，使赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴情不自禁地赞叹起来。他们愈往前走，树木的种类就愈多。河右岸生长着美丽的榆树科植物，这种为建筑师珍视的榆树，即使长期浸在水里，也不致腐烂。此外还有同科的其他许多类树木，其中有一种较为特殊，它的果仁含有一种非常有用的油。再往前去，赫伯特又发现了木通科植物，这是一种盘藤灌木，它的枝条在水里浸过以后，可以做成极好的索具，他还看见两三棵黑檀，带有美丽的黑色奇异花纹。
平底船一到好靠岸的地方总要停下来，吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫就拿着枪，随着托普跳上去。除了猎得一些野味外，还可以碰到一些有用的植物；少年自然学家发现了一种藜科的野生菠菜和白菜类的许多十字花科蔬菜——这种蔬菜是一定可以移植的——感到非常高兴，这里还有水芹、萝卜、芜菁，最后还有一些一米高的多毛多枝丫的草茎植物，结着褐色的种籽。
“你知道这是什么植物吗？”赫伯特向水手问道。
“烟草！”潘克洛夫大声说，显然，除了在他的烟斗里以外，他从来也没有见过这种他所心爱的植物。
“不是！潘克洛夫，”赫伯特说，“这不是烟草，是芥菜。”
“管它什么芥菜！”水手说；“可是孩子，假如你碰到烟草，可千万别放过它！”
“总有一天我们会找到的！”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“好吧！”潘克洛夫大声说，“等到那时候，我就想不出我们的岛上还缺些什么了！”
他们把各种各样的植物小心翼翼地连根挖起来，带回了平底船，这时，赛勒斯•史密斯还在那里想心事。
通讯记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫就这样不断地上岸，有时上慈悲河的右岸，有时上左岸。
慈悲河的左岸比较平坦，可是右岸的树木却更茂密。工程师看了一下他的袖珍指南针，河的方向从第一个拐弯起，显然是从西南到东北，大约三英里之内几乎是笔直的。然而在第一个拐弯以后，方向就可能改变了，慈悲河上游可能朝西北伸去，直到河流的发源地，富兰克林山的支脉。
途中有一次登岸，吉丁•史佩莱竟捉住了四只鹑鸡。这种鸟的嘴又薄又长，头颈细长，翅膀短小，尾巴几乎没有。赫伯特恰如其分地把它们叫做鹌鹑，他们决定饲养这些鹑鸡，作为他们未来家禽场上的第一批住客。
直到这时候，他们还没有开过枪，第一声枪响是在远西森林中发出的，他们发现了一只类似鱼狗的美丽飞鸟。
“我认识它！”潘克洛夫喊道，他的枪不由自主地从肩膀上滑了下来。
“你认识什么？”通讯记者问道。
“我们第一次打猎的时候逃走的那只飞鸟，我们曾用它来给那一带的森林命名。”
“啄木鸟！”赫伯特喊道。
不错，这是一只啄木鸟，它的羽毛发着金属的光泽。一颗子弹把它打下来，托普把它衔到平底船去了，同时又打下了半打猩猩鹦鹉。它们的大小和鸽子差不多，羽毛掺杂着绿色，翅膀部分是深红的，冠毛镶着一道白边。这些鹦鹉是少年打下来的，他感到非常得意。猩猩鹦鹉比啄木鸟要好吃得多，因为啄木鸟的肉太粗了。可是要让潘克洛夫承认他所打到的不是最好吃的飞禽，却不是一件容易的事。早上十点钟，平底船来到了离慈悲河口将近五英里的第二个拐角。他们就在这里停下来，在美丽的树荫下吃早饭。这里河流的宽度还有六十到七十英尺，河床的深度则在五六英尺左右。工程师发现支流愈来愈多了，可是这些支流不能通航，因为它们不过是一些小溪。周围的森林（包括啄木鸟林和远西森林在内）一眼望不到边。无论是在森林的深处，还是在慈悲河岸的大树底下，都没有人迹。探险的人们找不到丝毫可疑的迹象。看得出来，这些树木根本没有被砍柴斧碰过。丫杈横生的灌木和深草丛中大树间的爬藤也不曾被开路的人用刀砍过。假如遇难的人确是上过荒岛的话，他们决不会已经离岸了，然而丛林里却没法找到这些在假定的遇难中脱险的人。
因此工程师急于要到林肯岛的西海岸去，据他估计，这段距离至少还有五英里。
他们继续航行，慈悲河现在好象不是朝着海岸流，而是往富兰克林山流去。他们决定只要河水还能叫船浮得起来，就照常用平底船向前进。这样既省力，又不浪费时间，要不然，他们就必须用斧头在密林中开路。可是潮水不久就失去了作用，不知是因为退潮（现在已经到退潮的时候了），还是离开慈悲河口太远，总之，觉察不到海潮是在往前流动了，于是他们只好利用双桨，赫伯特和纳布每人拿了一支，潘克洛夫摇起橹来继续逆流前进。树木愈来愈稀疏，树木之间的距离隔得很远，经常有些大树孤零零地耸立着。可是它们彼此距离愈远，长得也就愈加美丽，这是因为树木之间空气流通的缘故。
这一带的植物是多么茂盛美丽啊！植物学家看了这些花草树木，一定可以毫不犹豫地说出林肯岛的纬度来的。
“有加利树！”赫伯特喊道。
不错，正是这种美丽的树木，这是一种亚热带的大树，和澳大利亚、新西兰（这两处都和林肯岛在同一纬度）的有加利树属于一类，这些树木有的高达二百英尺，树干下部周围有二十英尺，凹凸不平的树皮有五英寸厚，里面含有芳香的红色树脂。这种高大的桃金娘科树木真是新奇少有，它们的叶子是垂直的而不是水平的，也就是说，向上长着的是叶边，而不是叶面，因此，阳光很容易透过树木射下来。
有加利树底下是一片绿茵，一群小鸟从灌木丛中逃出来，它们在阳光里振翼飞翔，象长了翅膀的红宝石。
“好象是一种乔木！”纳布喊道；“可是它有用吗？”
“嘿！”潘克洛夫答道。“这些大树就好象大胖子似的，中看不中用。”
“我认为你错了，潘克洛夫，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“有加利树是制造家具的上等木料。”
“我还要补充一句，”赫伯特说，“有加利树的这一科包括很多有用的种类，其中番石榴的果实可以制造果子酱；丁香树出产香料；安石榴树结安石榴；桃金娘丁香树的果实可以酿造美酒；乌葛杨梅树含有很浓的酒精成分；石竹科的杨梅树皮可以制成珍贵的肉桂；尤琴椒树可以制造牙买加辣椒；普通杨梅的嫩芽和果子里有时可以提取胡椒。有加利树可以提供一种香料，几内亚有加利树的树液经过发酵可以制成啤酒。一句话，澳大利亚所有的橡皮树和铁皮树都属于这种桃金娘科，它包括四十六属和一千三百种。”
少年滔滔不绝地往下说，他兴致勃勃地把他在植物学上的一点常识全谈了出来。赛勒斯•史密斯一面听，一面微笑着，而潘克洛夫别有一种骄傲的心情。
“很好！赫伯特，”潘克洛夫说，“可是我敢打赌，这些大树决不是你刚才提到的那些有用的品种！”
“不错，潘克洛夫。”
“这就证实我刚才的话不错了，”水手接着说，“这些大树皮有什么用处！”
“那你就错了，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“我们头上这些高大的有加利树是有些用处的。”
“有什么用处？”
“保持当地的环境卫生。你知道澳洲和新西兰的居民把它们叫做什么吗？”
“不知道，史密斯先生。”
“把它们叫做‘寒热病树’。”
“是因为它们散布寒热病吗，”
“不，因为它们防止寒热病！”
“好，我要记下来。”通讯记者说。
“记下来吧！亲爱的史佩莱。有加利树可以驱除瘴气已经得到证实了。在中欧和北非，有许多国家的土壤对健康是非常有害的，这种自然的解毒药已经在那里试验过了，当地居民的卫生条件逐渐得到了改善。现在凡是有桃金娘科森林的地区，都没有疟疾了。这是已经得到证明的事实，因此这样的环境对我们这伙林肯岛上的居民是非常有利的。”
“啊！这个岛真不错！这个岛真太好了！”潘克洛夫喊道。“我说，这儿什么都有，只差……”
“会有的，潘克洛夫，会找到的，”工程师回答说；“可是现在我们要继续航行，河流允许我们航到哪里，我们就航到哪里！”
他们又继续前进了两个钟头，这一带长满了有加利树，荒岛的这部分森林里，主要是这种树。慈悲河弯弯曲曲地向前伸去，夹岸是高耸的绿色陡坡，河岸两边，都是望不到边的有加利树。河床里不时发现很长的水草，甚至还有一些突出的岩石，给航行增加很大的困难。划桨受到了阻碍，于是潘克洛夫只好用一支长竿来撑船。他们发觉河水愈来愈浅，平底船很快就要不好走了。太阳已经向水平线沉下去，满地都是长长的树影。赛勒斯•史密斯知道要想一下子就到达荒岛的西岸是不可能的了，即使要继续航行，河水又太浅，于是决定就地宿营。他估计他们离海滨还有五六英里，要在黑夜穿过陌生的丛林走完这一段距离，显然是太远了。
平底船穿过森林向前行驶，现在森林又渐渐地密起来，而且看来这里“人烟”似乎比较稠密，假如水手没有看错的话，他好象看见树上有许多猴子在跳跃。有两三只猴子甚至来到平底船的近旁，瞪着眼瞧他们，一点也不害怕，仿佛是初次看到人类，还不懂得害怕似的。要想一枪打中一只这样的猴子是非常容易的。潘克洛夫很想试一试，可是史密斯却不赞成这种毫无意义的屠杀。这样做比较谨慎，因为这种猴子（其实是人猿）看起来非常灵活有力，无缘无故地侵犯它们大可不必，况且它们很可能会不顾火器的威力，向探险家进攻。不错，水手是纯粹从食物观点来看这群猴子的，他知道这种草食动物是极佳的野味，可是既然他们的口粮还很充裕，那么浪费火药就未免有些可惜了。
到四点钟的时候，由于水生植物和岩石阻塞了河道，在慈悲河上航行更加困难了。两岸愈来愈高，他们已经接近富兰克林山的支脉，离慈悲河的源头不会太远了，因为它就是由南面山坡的涧水汇合而成的。
“一刻钟以内，”水手说，“我们就非停船不可了，史密斯先生。”
“很好，就停吧，潘克洛夫，我们要扎一个野营。”
“我们离‘花岗石宫’有多远了？”赫伯特问道。
“把河道的弯曲也计算在内的话，”工程师说，“我们来到了西北方七英里左右的地方。”
“我们还要继续往前走吗？”通讯记者问道。
“是的，只要能往前走，我们还要往前走，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答。“明儿天一亮就离开平底船，我希望在两个钟头之内能够到达海滨，那样我们就可以有一整天的工夫巡视海岸了。”
“那么就往前走！”潘克洛夫道。
可是平底船马上触到了石头的河底，现在河宽至多不过二十英尺。两岸的树木在河上搭成一个凉棚，使周围的环境半明半暗。他们还听见奔腾澎湃的瀑布声，几百英尺的上游显然有一道天然的障碍。
河身突然拐了一个弯以后，他们透过树木的间隙看见一个瀑布。平底船又碰到河底了，几分钟以后，它在右侧的一棵大树下靠了岸。
快五点钟了。浓密的枝叶间闪耀着落日的余辉，它照在这个小小的瀑布上，使溅起的水珠形成了一道七彩长虹。再往前，慈悲河就在远处的灌木丛中消失了，那里隐蔽着它的源泉。在这以下有无数支流向它汇合拢来，使它成为一条正规的河流，可是在这儿它只是一脉清澈的浅溪。
周围景色优美，大家都同意在这里露宿。他们跳下船来，立刻在一丛小树下升起一堆篝火，假如必要的话，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们还可以在附近的大树杈枝上过夜。
大家都饿了，他们风卷残云般地吃完了晚饭，然后只等睡觉。可是，在入夜的时候，他们听到一种可疑的咆哮声。为了保障这群人平安地睡觉，他们燃起了一堆旺盛的烈火，火堆僻僻啪啪地响着。纳布和潘克洛夫轮流守夜，不断地大量加添燃料。他们在黑暗中仿佛看见从灌木丛中出来一些野兽围绕着帐篷偷偷地走来走去。可是这一夜毕竟安然度过了。第二天，10月31日，他们早上五点钟就都起来了，准备重新上路。
Book 2 Chapter 4
It was six o' clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty breakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of the island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding had said two hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the obstacles they might meet with As it was probable that they would have to cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe in hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries of the wild beasts heard in the night.
The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing of Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance of less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the southwest to reach the western coast. They set out, having first carefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient provision for the little band for at least two days. It would not thus be necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his companions to refrain from firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore. The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the midst of some mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass in his hand, Cyrus Harding led the way.
The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There were deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus, cedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number prevented their growth.
Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some subterranean marsh or by some stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not remember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any other watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.
During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose appearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether these active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his companions as degenerate brothers.
And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by creepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple animals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing on their course. The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not manifest any hostile disposition.
Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two or three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.
"But," said he, "you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or two words to say to you on our way back!"
At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek was deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable.
"We are cut off!" cried Neb.
"No," replied Herbert, "it is only a stream, and we can easily swim over."
"What would be the use of that?" returned Harding. "This creek evidently runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the coast. Forward!"
"One minute," said the reporter. "The name of this creek, my friends? Do not let us leave our geography incomplete."
"All right!" said Pencroft.
"Name it, my boy," said the engineer, addressing the lad.
"Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?" answered Herbert.
"Very well," replied Cyrus Harding. "Let us follow it as fast as we can without stopping."
"Still another minute!" said Pencroft.
"What's the matter?" asked the reporter.
"Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose," said the sailor.
"We have no time to lose," replied the engineer.
"Oh! five minutes!" replied Pencroft, "I only ask for five minutes to use in the interest of our breakfast!"
And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water, and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.
"These will be good!" cried Neb, going to the sailor's aid.
"As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!" muttered Pencroft with a sigh.
The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in the creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a cobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.
They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of a large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none were actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest that the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a grinder.
In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western coast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had only been a few miles distant. Now, this effect was not produced, and the water pursued its natural course. The engineer was much astonished at this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that some turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.
However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less tumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not bark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood.
At half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who was a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,--
"The sea!"
In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay extended before the eyes of the settlers.
But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which chance had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a sandy beach. The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending over the water were beaten by the waves. It was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand, or by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees. The bank was raised a little above the level of the sea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island.
The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor, which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It served as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that its waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a height of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.
It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this stream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for a space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond that again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line, which ran north and south. On the contrary, all the part of the shore between Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent trees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed their roots. Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine Peninsula, that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered a refuge to castaways, which the other wild and barren side must have refused.
The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which Neb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There was, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore as far as the eye could reach. But the engineer would take nothing for granted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.
Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave the signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore.
The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about twelve miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this, on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they needed double the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut down, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey.
There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place recently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of it might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted that because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been castaway on the coast.
The reporter's argument was just, and besides, the incident of the bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within three months.
It was already five o'clock, and there were still two miles between the settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident that after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source of the Mercy. It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the promontory. But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for there were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary, abound--jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots, cockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not a tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping wings.
Towards seven o'clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here the seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance of a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something might be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration had to be put off to the next day.
Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their camp. Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found several thick clumps of bamboos.
"Good," said he; "this is a valuable discovery."
"Valuable?" returned Pencroft.
"Certainly," replied Herbert. "I may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper; that the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes and are used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent material for building, being light and strong, and being never attacked by insects. I will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint, keeping for the bottom the part of the transverse film which forms the joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much in use among the Chinese. No! you don't care for that. But--"
"But what?"
"But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these bamboos are eaten like asparagus."
"Asparagus thirty feet high!" exclaimed the sailor. "And are they good?"
"Excellent," replied Herbert. "Only it is not the stems of thirty feet high which are eaten, but the young shoots."
"Perfect, my boy, perfect!" replied Pencroft.
"I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in vinegar, makes a good pickle."
"Better and better, Herbert!"
"And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made into a very agreeable drink."
"Is that all?" asked the sailor.
"That is all!"
"And they don't happen to do for smoking?"
"No, my poor Pencroft."
Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass the night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the sea under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many cavities in which shelter could be found against the night air. But just as they were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested them.
"Back!" cried Pencroft. "Our guns are only loaded with small shot, and beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for grains of salt!" And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance of the cavern.
It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that is to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the beginning of its tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the white of its chest. Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of the tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest wolf!
The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men.
At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This was not his first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle. The jaguar collected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in the eyes, and it fell dead.
Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it lay stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be a great ornament to the hall at Granite House.
"Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!" cried Herbert, in a fit of very natural enthusiasm.
"Well, my boy," replied the reporter, "you could have done the same."
"I! with such coolness!--"
"Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you would fire as quietly as possible."
"That is," rejoined Pencroft, "that it is not more dangerous than a hare!"
"And now," said Gideon Spilett, "since the jaguar has left its abode, I do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the night."
"But others may come," said Pencroft.
"It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern," said the reporter, "and no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold."
"Into the jaguar's house, then!" replied the sailor, dragging after him the body of the animal.
While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant supply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.
Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he mingled with the other fuel.
This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they had supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion, or rather a series of reports, broke the silence! The noise was caused by the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like fireworks. The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts.
It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it for many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable wild beasts of Central Asia.
清晨六点钟，大家匆匆地吃完早饭，找一条捷径向荒岛的西岸出发了。多长的时间才能走到呢？赛勒斯•史密斯曾说过，需要两个钟头，可是这当然要看他们遇到的障碍性质如何。远西森林长满了一眼望不到边的各种灌木丛。他们可能要在荒草、灌木和爬藤之间开辟道路，因此手里拿着斧头。枪枝也准备好了，这是因为夜间听到野兽咆哮的缘故。
露宿的确实地点可以由富兰克林山的方位来决定，火山就在北而下到三英里的地方，他们只要笔直向西南走去就可以到达西岸了。他们把平底船小心地拴好，然后出发。潘克洛夫和纳布至少给小队准备了两三天的食粮。这样就不一定需要打猎了。工程师劝大家不要随便开枪，免得岸边知道这儿有人。他们第一次动用斧头的时候是在瀑布以上不远的一片乳香树丛里；赛勒斯•史密斯拿着指南针在前面引路。
附近森林里的树木大都在湖边和眺望岗上见到过。其中有喜马拉雅杉、洋松、柽柳、橡皮树、有加利树、木槿、杉树和其他树木，都是普通的大小，因为树木太密，妨碍了它们的生长，居民们需要一边开路一边走，因此不能走得很快。按照工程师的计划，打算在这里开一条路和红河的道路连接上。
出发以来，居民们已经从荒岛的高山斜坡地带来到了干燥的土地上。这里植物茂盛，说明它不是吸收了地下沼泽的水分，就是受过某些小河的灌溉。可是赛勒斯•史密斯记得在到火山口去的时候，除了红河和慈悲河以外，没有见过其他的水源。
在第一段行程中，他们遇到无数的猴子，这些猴子在看到它们从未见过的人类以后，都感到非常惊讶。吉丁•史佩莱打趣他说，也许这些活泼愉快的四足动物会把他们当作是自己的退化了的弟兄呢。
的确，这些徒步旅行的人每走一步都要受到灌木的阻碍，被爬藤勾住衣服，被树干拦住道路，而那些灵巧的动物，却能在树枝之间纵跳自如，通行无阻，和它们比较起来，人类显然逊色多了。幸亏这些猴子没有表示任何敌意。
他们还看见一些西瑞、刺鼠、袋鼠和其他的啮齿动物，潘克洛夫很想开枪打它们。
“你们现在跳吧，玩吧，”他说，“我们回来的时候再收拾你们！”
九点半的时候，突然有一条三四十英尺宽的不知名的河流拦住了前进的道路。湍急的河水冲击着河中央的岩石，溅起一片白沫。河水很深，也很清澈，但是完全不能通航。
“我们无路可走了！”纳布喊道。
“不，”赫伯特说，“这条小河算不了什么，我们可以很容易游过去。”
“那何必呢？”史密斯答道。“这条河显然是通向大海的。我们还是留在这边，沿着河岸走，要是不能马上到达海滨那才怪呢。前进！”
“等一会儿，”通讯记者说。“给这条河起个什么名字呢，朋友们？别在我们的地图上留下空白。”
“好！”潘克洛夫说。
“给它起个名字吧，孩子。”工程师对少年说。
“等我们到达河口以后再起不好吗？”赫伯特回答说。
“很好，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“我们不要停顿，尽快地沿河前进吧。”
“再等一会儿！”潘克洛夫说。
“什么事？”通讯记者间道。
“虽然不许打猎，我想捕鱼总可以吧？”水手说。
“我们不能浪费时间。”工程师答道。
“哎！只要五分钟！”潘克洛夫接着说，“为了我们的早餐着想，我只要五分钟！”
于是潘克洛夫趴在岸上，把胳膊伸到水里去，马上就从岩石缝里抓起好几打活琵琶虾来。
“好！”纳布一面前去帮助水手，一面说。
“我说，岛上什么都有，就是没有烟草！”潘克洛夫叹了口气，喃喃地说。
捕鱼的时间还不到五分钟，因为满河都是琵琶虾。他们装满了一袋湛蓝色的带壳动物。然后又继续上路了。
他们在河岸上比在森林里走得更快、更容易。他们不时发现一种动物的足迹，这是一种巨大的野兽，大概是到河边来喝水的，可是实际上却一只也看不见，显然，那只西瑞不是在这一带林中被枪弹——潘克洛夫曾被它崩掉一颗牙——打中的。
同时，史密斯从这股急流看出，他和他的伙伴们离西岸比自己原先想象的要远得多。的确，假如河口离开这儿只有几英里的话，上涨的潮水这时候一定要把河水顶回来了。可是事实上并不是这样，河水还是自由自在地流着，工程师感到非常奇怪，他不时拿出指南针来，看看是不是河流拐了几个弯又把他们带回远西森林去了。
河面终于宽起来，河水也不那么湍急了。右岸的树木和左岸同样稠密，要想透过树林看见什么东西简直不可能，可是这一片森林里目前显然没有人，因为托普没有叫，——要是附近有陌生人的话，这只机警的狗决不会没有一点表示的。
十点半的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯突然听见赫伯特在前面不远的地方停下来喊道：
“海！”
几分钟以后，荒岛西海岸的全景就呈现在他们的面前了。
可是这和他们无意中着陆的东海岸显得多么不同啊！这里没有花岗石的峭壁，没有岩石，甚至连沙滩也没有。森林一直伸展到海边，高大的树木俯身在海面上，激起的浪花飞溅着枝叶。一般的海岸不是一片广阔的沙滩，就是成堆的乱石，可是这里的海岸却和别处不同，它是一道边缘，上面生长着美丽无比的树木。海岸比水平面稍微高一些，这片肥沃的土壤下有着花岗石的基层，风雅宜人的森林生长在上面，和生长在荒岛内陆上的一样牢固。
他们来到了一个不知名的港岸上，这个海港只能勉强容纳两三艘渔船。它是一条通向新河的海峡，这条新河不同于一般的是：它的河水不是缓缓地流向大海，而是从一个高达四十多英尺的地方倾泻下去的，这就是他们在河的上游感觉不到涨潮的原因。的确，即使太平洋的潮水达到了最高潮，也决不可能升得跟这个河面一样高，而且无疑的，即使再过几百万年，潮水也没法把花岗石侵蚀成一个真正和海水相接的河口。
大家同意把这条河命名为瀑布河，迎面往北，森林的边缘连续约有二英里长，然后树木稀疏了，再往外去，风景如画的山岗从北到南几乎形成一条直线，相反的，在瀑布河和爬虫角之间的海岸上则全是森林，美丽的树木，有的笔直冲天，有的弯腰拂水，汹涌的海浪冲刷着它们的根部。现在，他们就要在这片海滨，也就是在整个的盘蛇半岛上进行搜索了，因为这部分海岸正是遇难者天然的栖身之地，其他空旷而荒芜的海岸是不能供他们居住的，
这一天天朗气清，纳布和潘克洛夫在一块山石上准备着早饭，这里可以看到很远的地方。周围没有一只船，视线之内什么也没有。可是在没有搜查到盘蛇半岛的海岸尽头以前，工程师是不肯罢休的。
早饭很快就吃完了，十一点半的时候工程师下令动身。为了能继续循着海岸前进，他们没有到峭壁和沙滩上去，只在大树的浓荫下穿行。
从瀑布河到爬虫角大约有十二英里。假如有一条平坦的道路，只要四个钟头就可以走到了，他们也不必匆忙，可是现在却需要双倍的时间，因为要绕着大树走，遇见灌木还要砍伐，有了爬藤必须斩断，每走一步都受到阻碍，这些困难大大地延长了行程。
这里丝毫看不出最近有船遇险的迹象。吉丁•史佩莱说得对，遗留下来的东西可能被海水冲走了，因此他们不能因为找不到踪迹，就认为根本没有船只在海滨遇险。
通讯记者的论点是正确的，况且枪弹的事情也证明了过去三个月内一定有人在林肯岛上开过枪。
已经五点钟了，他们离开盘蛇半岛的尽头还有二英里。事实很清楚，史密斯和他的伙伴们到达爬虫角以后，想在天黑以前赶回他们在慈悲河发源处的营地是来不及了，因此必须在海角上过夜。好在他们并不缺少粮食，岸上虽然没有走兽，却有大量的飞禽——啄木鸟、锦鸡、角雉、松鸡、猩猩鹦鹉、鹦鹉、红鹦鹉、野鸡、鸽子，以及许许多多其他鸟类。每一棵树上都有鸟窝，每一个鸟窝里都住着飞鸟。
将近七点钟的时候，探险家们拖着疲倦的脚步到达了爬虫角。这里是海边森林的尽头，海岸又恢复了原来的面貌：散布着岩石、暗礁和泥沙。这里很可能找到一些东西，可是夜幕已经低垂，进一步的搜索只好等到明天了。
潘克洛夫和赫伯特急忙寻找适合露宿的地方。少年在远西森林的尽头发现了几丛密集在一起的竹子。
“好呵，”他说，“这个发现很有价值。”
“有什么价值？”潘克洛夫问道。
“当然，”赫伯特回答说。“我可以告诉你，潘克洛夫，把竹子削成柔软的竹蔑可以用来编篮子；把竹皮捣成糊浆可以制造中国纸；根据竹竿的粗细，可以把它们做成竹竿和竹管，用来输水；极大的竹子是上等的建筑材料，因为它们既轻便又结实，而且不怕虫蛀。还有，齐竹节锯成一段一段的，一头带节，可以当杯子用，这种杯子在中国非常流行，不过，你对这个是不会发生兴趣的。可是……”
“可是什么？”
“假如你不知道的话，我可以告诉你，印度人把竹子当芦笋吃。”
“三十英尺高的芦笋！”水手叫道。“好吃吗？”
“好吃极了，”赫伯特回答说。“可是吃的并不是三十英尺高的竹竿，而是嫩芽。”
“好极了，孩子，好极了！”潘克洛夫答道。
“我再补充一句，把嫩茎剥去皮泡在醋里就成了上等的调味品。”
“愈说愈好了，赫伯特！”
“最后，竹子里还有一种香甜的汁水，可以用来制造一种非常可口的饮料。’
“完了吗？”水手问道。
“完了！”
“能够拿来当烟抽吗？”
“不能，可怜的潘克洛夫。”
赫伯特和水手很快就找到可以过夜的地方了。岩石上有许多洞穴，这多半是被西南风激起的海浪冲击成的，在这些洞穴里栖身，就可以避免夜晚的凉风。可是他们正打算走进一个洞去，突然听见一声吼叫。
“往后退！”潘克洛夫喊道。“我们的枪里装的都是小粒子弹，这只野兽能叫得这么响，看样子它是决不在乎的！”于是水手抓住赫伯特的肩膀，把他拉到一块岩石后面，正在这时候，一只彩色斑斓的野兽在洞口出现了。
这是一只美洲豹，大小至少和亚洲种差不多，也就是说，整个身子有五英尺长。它那金黄色的毛片上有着黛眉似的条纹和整齐的卵形黑点，和雪白的胸膛形成鲜明的对比。赫伯特知道它是老虎的劲敌，和大豺狼的劲敌花豹一样，都是可怕的猛兽！
它往前迈了一步，目光炯炯地望着周围，毛发倒竖起来，好象这已经不是第一次闻到人味了。
这时候通讯记者从一块石头后面跑了出来，赫伯特以为他没有看见野兽，正打算冲过去拦他，吉丁•史佩莱对他做了一个手势，教他不要动。他已经有遇见老虎的经验了，他走到离野兽只有十英尺的地方，一动也不动地站在那里，把枪抵在肩窝上，使全身肌肉完全保持不动。野兽正打算纵身跳过来，就在这时候，一枪打在豹的两眼之间，它就倒毙在地上了。
赫伯特和潘克洛夫向它跑去。纳布和史密斯也跑过来，他们注视了一会倒在地上的野兽，不禁想到，用那美丽的兽皮把“花岗石宫”的大厅装饰起来真是太美了。
“啊，史佩莱先生，我真是既羡慕你又妒忌你！”赫伯特不禁热烈地喊道。
“好，孩子，”通讯记者答道，“你也能做到的。”
“我！这么沉着！……”
“赫伯特，你只当它是一只野兔子，就能非常沉着地开枪打它了。”
“对啊，”潘克洛夫答道，“它并不比兔子狡猾！”
“现在，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“它已经把窝让出来了，朋友们，我们干吗还不进去过夜呢？”
“也许还有别的野兽会来。”潘克洛夫说。
“在洞口燃起一堆火，”通讯记者说，“野兽就不敢进门了。”
“那么，到豹窝里去吧！”水手拖着野兽说。
于是，纳布留下来剥豹皮，他的同伴们到森林里捡了许多干柴来堆在洞口。
赛勒斯•史密斯看见那丛竹子以后，就砍下一些来，和木柴放在一堆。
做完这些事，他们就钻进洞去了，洞里到处都是白骨，他们准备好枪枝，以防突然遇到袭击；吃过晚饭，在临睡以前，他们把洞口的篝火点了起来。一阵阵的爆炸声（说得更确切些，是一连串的爆炸声）打破了周围的沉寂！这是竹子的声音，当火焰烧到它们的时候，它们就象炮仗似的爆炸起来。任何胆大的野兽听了这一片响声也要胆寒的。
这种产生巨响的爆炸法不是工程师发明的，据马可孛罗说，好几世纪以来，中亚细亚的鞑靼人都是用这种方法来驱散到他们的帐篷附近来的野兽。
Book 2 Chapter 5
Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave which the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.
At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and their gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of the circumference were visible. For the last time the engineer could ascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and even with the telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered.
There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line of three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for beyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen.
The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?
This was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was abandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to Granite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought that the western coast would have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel in her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no good anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been able to find on the west.
Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question of the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what distance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula.
"About thirty miles," replied the engineer, "if we take into consideration the curvings of the coast."
"Thirty miles!" returned Spilett. "That would be a long day's march. Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the south coast."
"But," observed Herbert, "from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be at least another ten miles.
"Make it forty miles in all," replied the engineer, "and do not hesitate to do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall not have to begin the exploration again."
"Very good," said Pencroft. "But the boat?"
"The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the Mercy," replied Gideon Spilett; "it may just as well stay there two days! As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is infested by thieves!"
"Yet," said the sailor, "when I remember the history of the turtle, I am far from confident of that."
"The turtle! the turtle!" replied the reporter. "Don't you know that the sea turned it over?"
"Who knows?" murmured the engineer.
"But,--" said Neb.
Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and yet said nothing.
"What do you want to say, Neb?" asked the engineer.
"If we return by the shore to Claw Cape," replied Neb, "after having doubled the Cape, we shall be stopped--"
"By the Mercy! of course," replied Herbert, "and we shall have neither bridge nor boat by which to cross."
"But, captain," added Pencroft, "with a few floating trunks we shall have no difficulty in crossing the river."
"Never mind," said Spilett, "it will be useful to construct a bridge if we wish to have an easy access to the Far West!"
"A bridge!" cried Pencroft. "Well, is not the captain the best engineer in his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to transporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that without wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We have provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game. Forward!"
The reporter's proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received general approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest, and by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would he ended. But there was not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they could not hope to reach Granite House before night.
At six o'clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution the guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received orders to beat about the edge of the forest.
From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no debris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a footprint!
From the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their gaze could extend along the southwest. Twenty-five miles off the coast terminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning mists, and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if suspended between land and water.
Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land, bordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more irregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw Cape.
Such was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.
"If a vessel ran in here," said Pencroft, "she would certainly be lost. Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!"
"But at least something would be left of the ship," observed the reporter.
"There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands," replied the sailor.
"Why?"
"Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they swallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!"
"So, Pencroft," asked the engineer, "if a ship has been wrecked on these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her remaining?"
"No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should not have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves."
"Let us go on with our search, then," returned Cyrus Harding.
At one o'clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington Bay, they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.
They then halted for breakfast.
Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and sandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in the bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs.
Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which encumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in height, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be seen.
After half an hour's rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not a spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they found nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them. They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there, but these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been established between the two banks of the Mercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected.
Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull of a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spans would have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was found twenty miles from here. But there was nothing.
Towards three o'clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug little creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea, and was entered by a narrow channel.
At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper plateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and consequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here. They agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites; and although it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to strengthen himself with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain them until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House. In a few minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines, were devouring the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.
This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the sea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union Bay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon.
It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which the explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon with his glass, no vessel could be found.
The shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of the instrument.
"Well," said Gideon Spilett, "it seems we must make up our minds to console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us the possession of Lincoln Island!"
"But the bullet," cried Herbert. "That was not imaginary, I suppose!"
"Hang it, no!" exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.
"Then what conclusion may be drawn?" asked the reporter.
"This," replied the engineer, "that three months or more ago, a vessel, either voluntarily or not, came here."
"What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving any trace?" cried the reporter.
"No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human being set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now left it."
"Then, if I understand you right, captain," said Herbert, "the vessel has left again?"
"Evidently."
"And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?" said Neb.
"I fear so."
"Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can't be helped," said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House.
But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.
Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!
Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his master to follow him into the forest.
"Now there's something to explain the bullet!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"A castaway!" replied Herbert.
"Wounded, perhaps!" said Neb.
"Or dead!" added the reporter.
All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest. Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an emergency.
They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment, they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way. Shrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away with the axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest. It was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there, but yet Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at random, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an idea.
In about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with tall trees. The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither under the bushes nor among the trees.
"What is the matter, Top?" said Cyrus Harding.
Top barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at once Pencroft shouted,--"Ho, splendid! capital!"
"What is it?" asked Spilett.
"We have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!"
"Well?"
"Well; and here we've found one in the air!"
And the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the pine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.
"But that is not a wreck!" cried Gideon Spilett.
"I beg your pardon!" returned Pencroft.
"Why? is it--?"
"It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!"
Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a tremendous hurrah, adding,--
"There is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for years. There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr. Spilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?"
It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island that the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had fallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it again, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether they wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully employed the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality. Pencroft's joy was therefore shared by all.
But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb, Herbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon.
The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its valve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that is to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the circle and the anchor. The case, except for the fracture, was in good condition, only the lower portion being torn.
It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.
"All the same, captain," said the sailor, "if we ever decide to leave the island, it won't be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won't go where we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way! Look here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can make a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the rest of it, that will help to dress us."
"We shall see, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding; "we shall see."
"In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place," said Neb.
They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth, ropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very considerable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to convey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be left longer exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The settlers, uniting their efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they discovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not be visited either by the wind or rain.
"We needed a locker, and now we have one," said Pencroft; "but as we cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don't mean from two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!"
At six o'clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek the very suitable name of "Port Balloon," the settlers pursued their way along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different projects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest possible delay. It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the Mercy, so as to establish an easy communication with the south of the island; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the canoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and Pencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake voyages of circumnavigation round the island, etc.
In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the settlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.
The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four miles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the mouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by the Mercy.
There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross, but as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he was compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty tired. The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the balloon had not rested either their arms or legs. They were anxious to reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been constructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home.
The night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by constructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy. He and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began to attack them at the base.
Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their companions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though without going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had strolled by the river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,--
"What is floating there?"
Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through the gloom,--
"A canoe!" cried he.
All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down the current.
"Boat ahoy!" shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would be best to keep silence.
No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,--
"But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down the current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely."
"Our boat?" murmured the engineer.
Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the Mercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should have swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft cleverly managed this by means of a long pole.
The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found, on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing against the rocks.
"Well," said the reporter to him, in a low voice, "this is a strange thing."
"Strange indeed!" returned Cyrus Harding.
Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and Pencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having been worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the boat should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to seize it on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would have been lost in the sea.
If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would have given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some supernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!
A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the Mercy. The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all proceeded towards the ladder of Granite House.
But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the first steps, uttered a cry.
There was no longer a ladder!
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们在美洲豹礼让给他们的山洞里，象土拨鼠似的睡了一夜。
日出的时候，他们都来到了海角尽头的海岸上，仔细观察着海面；这里能看到周围三分之二的水平线。工程师最后一次断定了海上既没有一只航行的船，也没有一只难船的残骸，甚至用望远镜也看不见任何可疑的东西。
岸上也是这样，至少在形成海角南边三英里长的一条直线上什么也没有，因为海岸的其他部分被隆起的高地遮住了，而且即使在盘蛇半岛的尽头，也看不见爪角。
荒岛的南岸还没有视察过。他们要不要马上就出发，是不是到那里去花上11月2日整天的时间呢？
这一点他们最初并没有计划在内。当他们在慈悲河发源的地方弃舟登岸的时候，只是决定在西岸观察一下，然后到船上来，从慈悲河回“花岗石宫”去。当时史密斯认为西岸是能住人的，不论是遇难的船，还是在正常航行中的船只都可能在这里停泊。可是他现在发现这里并没有适合抛锚的地方，因此他打算到南边去，在那里也许可以找到他们在西边所没有发现的东西。
吉丁•史佩莱建议继续探索，以便完全解决这个假定的遇险问题，他问爪角离半岛尽头大概有多远。
“假如把海岸的曲折计算在内的话，”工程师答道，“大概有三十英里。”
“三十英里！”史佩莱说。“这可得走一些天呢。不过，我想我们可以从南部海滨回‘花岗石宫’去。”
“可是，”赫伯特说，“从爪角到‘花岗石宫’至少还有十英里。”
“一共算它四十英里吧，”通讯记者说，“别害怕。我们对于陌生的海岸总得视察一下，这样以后就不需要重新探索了。”
“很好，”潘克洛夫说。“可是平底船呢？”
“船已经留在慈悲河的发源地一天了，”吉丁•史佩莱答道，“留两天也不要紧！到目前为止，我们还没有理由认为岛上有贼！”
“可是，”水手说，“我一想起海龟的事情来，就没法相信这一点了。”
“海龟！海龟！”通讯记者说。“你还不相信是海水把它翻过来的吗？”
“谁知道呢。”工程师喃喃地说。
“可是……”纳布说。
纳布显然有话要说，然而他张开了嘴，却没有说下去。
“你想说什么，纳布。”工程师问道。
“假如我们沿着海岸回爪角去，”纳布回答说。“绕过爪角，我们的去路就要被拦住……”
“被慈悲河拦住了！当然罗，”赫伯特接着说，“我们既没有桥又没有船可以渡河。”
“可是，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫补充道，“只要有几根树干，我们就可以毫不困难地渡过河去的。”
“不要紧，”史佩莱说，“假如我们打算找一条近路到远西森林去的话，我们就有必要搭一座桥！”
“一座桥！”潘克洛夫喊道。“对啦，史密斯先生不是最好的工程师吗？必要的时候他可以给我们搭桥的。至于大家在今天晚上要到慈悲河的对岸去，这个我可以负责，保证让你们身上一滴水也不沾。我们还有一天的粮食，而且我们还可以打到大量的野味。走吧！”
通讯记者的建议在水手的热烈支持下，得到了大家的一致赞同，事实上人人都希望解决疑团，从爪角回去就可以完成探险任务。可是现在连一个钟头也不容浪费了，因为四十英里是一段漫长的路程，他们不到天黑休想回到“花岗石宫”。
早上六点钟，小队出发了。为了谨慎起见，枪里都装上了子弹，托普被派在森林的边缘搜索，大家跟在它后面前进。
半岛的尾端形成一个海角，从海角的尽头算起，海岸的周围长达五英里。这一段海岸很快就搜查完毕了，甚至经过最仔细的检查也没有发现任何过去或现在有人登陆的痕迹：没有残存的东西，没有扎营的迹象，没有燃烧的灰烬，连一个脚印也没有！
居民们到达了海角，弧形地带就到这里为止，以后就拐向东北，形成华盛顿湾。从这里可以看到整个的南部海滨，它的尽头就是二十五英里以外的爪角。透过清晨的薄雾，可以隐约看见爪角的轮廓。由于人们的错觉，它好象是悬挂在陆地和海洋之间的。
从他们所站的地方到对面的巨大港湾之间，海岸一共可以分成三个部分，眼前一带地势平坦，背景是一片森林；往前看，海岸比较曲折，许多尖角突出在海面上；最后直到爪角是一片黑色的岩石，它们堆成一片零乱的图案。
这就是荒岛上这一部分的形势，他们停留了片刻，大概地看了一下。
“假如有船到这儿来，”潘克洛夫说，“那它非沉不可。到处是沙洲和暗礁！这个地方太险了！”
“要是船沉了，总会遗留下一些东西的。”通讯记者说。
“石头上也许会有木片，可是沙滩上却不会有。”水手说。
“为什么？”
“因为沙滩比石头还要危险，不管什么东西掉在上面，都会陷下去的。上百吨的大船只要几天，就会连船身都不见了！”
“那么，潘克洛夫，”工程师问道，“假如有船在这儿遇了险，现在找不着它的遗迹，不是就没有什么奇怪了吗！”
“不错，史密斯先生，加上时间和风暴的原因，这是不足为奇的。可是，即使在这种情况之下，居然没有一点桅杆和圆木被抛到波浪达不到的海岸上来，这还是本能想象的。”
“那么，我们继续寻找吧。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
他们走了二十英里的路程，到达了华盛顿湾的另一边，这时已经是下午一点钟了。
于是他们停下来吃饭。
海岸从这里开始曲折起来，布满了岩石和沙洲。波涛久久地冲击着海湾中的岩石，形成一道水花四溅的边缘。从这个海角直到爪角，森林和礁石之间的海岸非常狭窄。
由于海滩上有许多岩石，现在走路更加困难了。愈往前，花岗石的峭壁愈高，只看得见它的顶端有绿色的树梢。
休息了半个钟头之后，他们又继续赶路了，岩石之间到处都要检查一番。潘克洛夫和纳布只要发现一样东西，甚至在海浪里也要冲过去看一看。可是他们什么也没有发现，只是一些奇形怪状的石头迷惑了他们。有一点他们倒是肯定了，就是附近盛产可以食用的蛤蜊，可是现在慈悲河两岸之间来往还很不方便，运输困难，这个发现对他们并没有多大价值。
在海岸上，他们没有发现任何东西可以帮助他们解释明白这个假定的遇险。虽然任何一件值得注意的东西（例如难船的残骸）都逃不出他们的眼睛，任何一根桅杆和圆木都和二十英里以外的那只箱子一样，可能被冲上岸来，可是什么都没有发现。
将近三点钟的时候，史密斯和他的伙伴们来到了一条畅流的小溪边。小溪形成一个天然的港口，这个港口在海里是看不见的，只有通过一条狭长的海峡，才能进来。
在小溪的背后，剧烈的地震把岩石的边地分裂开来了，从一个破口往上去，可以经过一个角度很小的斜坡来到一块高地上，这块高地离爪角至少十英里，因此，它和眺望岗的直线距离也就是四英里。吉丁•史佩莱向伙伴们建议在这儿休息一下。大家马上同意了，因为经过一番跋涉以后，他们都觉得很饿，虽然还不到平时吃饭的时候，可是谁也不反对吃一点儿野味来充饥。这一顿饭可以使他们一直维持到吃晚饭的时候，而晚饭他们是打算回到“花岗石宫”以后再吃的。几分钟以后，大家坐在一丛美丽的海松下面，纳布从口袋里拿出食品，他们就狼吞虎咽地吃起来了。
这个地方高出海面五六十英尺。周围的视野很广，可是在海角以外，只能看到联合湾。由于隆起的地面和森林形成一道屏障，遮住了北边的地平线，因此在这里就看不见，也不可能看见小岛和眺望岗了。
不用说，虽然他们可以看到很大的一片海洋，虽然工程师用望远镜扫视了水平线，结果还是找不到船只的踪迹。
自然，海岸上从水边到峭壁都同样仔仔细细地查看过了，即使用仪器也检查不出任何东西来。
“好吧，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“看样子我们可以放心了，大概不会有人来和我们争夺林肯岛了！”
“可是那颗枪弹，”赫伯特大声说，“那不是凭空想象出来的吧！”
“该死，不是的！”潘克洛夫喊道，他又想起他的缺牙来。
“那么该怎么下结论呢？”通讯记者问道。
“那就是，”工程师回答说，“三个月以前，或者更早一些，不管有意无意，是有一只船上这儿来过的！”
“什么！赛勒斯，那么你认为它是一点痕迹也不留地陷到沙滩里去了吗？”通讯记者叫道。
“不，亲爱的史佩莱！你想，我们既然可以肯定有人到岛上来过，同样也可以肯定他现在已经离开这儿了。”
“那么，假如我没有误会的话，史密斯先生，”赫伯特说，“你是说船又走了吗？”
“当然。”
“我们错过了一个回国的机会了吗？”纳布问道。
“恐怕是的。”
“很好，既然已经失去了机会，我们就继续赶路吧；这也没有法子。”潘克洛夫说，他不禁怀念起“花岗石宫”这个老家来。
他们正打算起身，突然听见托普大叫，它从森林里跑出来，嘴里衔着一块满是泥污的破布。
纳布一把抢过来。这是一块很结实的布！
托普还在叫，它来回乱跑，好象要喊它的主人跟它到森林里去似的。
“现在可以猜破枪弹的哑谜了！”潘克洛夫大声说。
“这儿有遇险的人！”赫伯特说。
“也许受了伤！”纳布说。
“也许死了！”通讯记者作了补充。
他们都在森林边缘的大松树底下跟着狗跑。史密斯和他的伙伴们都准备好了火器，以防万一。
他们在森林里走了一程，还是没有发现有人从这里经过的痕迹，不禁有些失望。灌木和爬藤都没有遭到损坏，他们甚至象在密林里一样，需要用斧头去砍它们。很难想象这里曾经有人走过，可是托普还是来回乱跑，看起来这只狗不象是在随意找什么，而象一个有头脑的人在追索一件心事。
七八分钟以后，托普在许多株大树之间的空地上停住了，他们看看周围，可是灌木丛下和大树之间都没有什么。
“怎么了，托普？”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
托普叫得更响了，在一棵高大的松树下跳跃着。突然潘克洛夫喊道：
“啊，好！太好了！”
“什么？”史佩莱问道。
“我们到海里和陆地上去找遇难的船！”
“怎么？”
“怎么，现在却在空中找到了！”
水手指着勾在一棵松树顶上的一大块白布，托普衔给他们的就是上面掉下来的一小片。
“这也不是破船呀！”吉丁•史佩莱大声说。
“对不起！”潘克洛夫答道。
“怎么？是……？”
“这就是我们的飞船，我们的气球遗留下来的全部东西，全在上头呢，在那棵树顶上！”
潘克洛夫没有错，他高兴得大叫起来：
“这些布很好！这些布够我们用好几年呢。我们可以用它做手帕和衬衫！哈哈，史佩莱先生，这个荒岛的树上能结衬衫，你说怎么样？”
气球在最后一次的空中飞行以后，居然落在岛上，使他们失而复得，这对林肯岛上的这群居民来说，不管他们是打算就这样把它留起来，还是用它回到故土，或者是打算很好地去了布上的漆，利用这几百码上等棉布，都是一件莫大的喜享。因此人人都和潘克洛夫一样高兴。
现在，首先必须把这个残缺不全的气球从树上取下来，好好地保存着，这可不是一件简单的事情。纳布、赫伯特和水手爬到树上去，想办法去解这个瘪了气的气球。
他们工作了两个钟头以后，不但把带有活门、弹簧和黄铜零件的气囊拿到地上来，而且网子（也就是大量绳索）、套环和吊绳也都取下来了。气囊除了一小部分——只是下部扯坏了——以外，其他完好无缺。
这真是喜从天降。
“一样的，史密斯先生，”水手说，“即使我们决定离开这个岛，我们也不会乘气球，是不是？这种飞船不会听我们摆布，爱上哪儿就上哪儿去的，我们在这方面已经有相当的经验了！你瞧，我们可以造一只二十来吨重的船，用那些布做一面主帆，一面前帆和一面三角帆。剩下来的布就用它做衣服穿。”
“再说吧，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“再说吧。”
“在没处理以前，一定要把它放在一个安全的地方。”纳布说。
当然，目前他们是没法把这些布和绳索搬回“花岗石宫”去的，因为分量相当重，需要找一辆适当的车子才能搬运，在搬运以前，不能把这些宝贝留在露天的地方，听凭雨打风吹。在共同努力之下，他们把它一直拖到岸边，那里有一个石头洞，根据它的位置，这里是不会有风雨侵入的。
“我们需要过一个柜子，现在有了，”潘克洛夫说，“可是我们没法上锁；为了谨慎起见，还是把洞口堵起来吧。我倒不是怕两条腿的贼来偷，我担心的是那些四只脚的野兽！”
六点钟的时候，一切都收拾停当了，他们给小溪起了一个恰当的名字叫气球港，然后就沿着爪角继续前进了。潘克洛夫和工程师讨论了许多计划，他们一致主张不要耽搁，尽快地去实现这些计划，首先必须在慈悲河上架一座桥，以便和荒岛的南部联络，然后拉着大车来，把气球运回去，单靠平底船是没法把它装回去的；再下一步他们就可以造一只带甲板的船，潘克洛夫打算造一艘单桅快船，他们可以用来环航全岛，以及做其他用途。
这时候黑夜降临了，当他们走到发现宝箱的遗物角时，天色已经昏黑。在这里，和在别处一样，还是找不到一点难船的痕迹，再一次证实了史密斯以前所下的结论。
遗物角离“花岗石宫”还有四英里，他们沿着海岸来到慈悲河口，抵达慈悲河第一个拐角的时候，已经是午夜了。
这里的河面有八十英尺宽，要想渡河是很困难的，可是潘克洛夫事先已经提出保证要克服这个困难，因此他只好硬着头皮去想办法。这一行人已经疲惫不堪了。他们走了很长的一段路，而且在取下气球时又费尽了手脚。他们恨不得马上就回到“花岗石官”里去，饱餐一顿，然后睡觉，假如河上有桥的话，只要一刻钟，他们就可以到家了。
夜色非常黑暗。潘克洛夫打算实践自己的诺言，制造一个木筏以便渡过慈悲河。他和纳布各自拿着利斧，在河边选了两棵树，齐根砍伐起来。
赛勒斯•史密斯和史佩莱坐在岸边，准备去帮助伙伴们，赫伯特在附近徘徊。少年走到河边以后，突然跑回来指着慈悲河喊道：
“什么东西在那儿漂？”
潘克洛夫停止了工作，在黑暗中隐隐约约看见有一个东西在移动。
“一只平底船！”他喊道。
大家都跑上前去，果然有一只小船顺流而下，他们不禁大吃一惊。
“来船注意！”水手喊道，他也不考虑一下，是不是不作声更好些。
没有回答，小船继续向前漂来；离他们至多不过十二英尺的时候，水手突然喊道：
“是我们的船呀！它的绳子断了，所以才顺水漂流下来的。来得正好。”
“我们的船？”工程师喃喃地说。
潘克洛夫没有看错。正是他们的平底船，船上的绳索肯定是断了，它是从慈悲河的上游一直漂来的。现在必须把它截住，否则急流就要把它冲出河口去了，纳布和潘克洛夫用长竿巧妙地把它搭住了。
平底船靠岸了。工程师首先跳了进去，经过检查以后，发现绳子果然是在岩石上磨断的。
“哼，”通讯记者轻轻地对他说，“这真是怪事。”
“的确奇怪！”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。
不管奇怪不奇怪，他们是幸运的。赫伯特、通讯记者、纳布和潘克洛夫都陆续上了船。绳子是磨断的已经没有疑问，奇怪的是：这只船竟不前不后在这时候被他们半路截住，早一刻钟或是晚一刻钟，它就要漂流到大海里去了。
他们生活的时代已经不是神话时代了，要不然，他们一定会认为荒岛上有什么神仙在暗中保佑他们呢！
他们划了几桨，就到了慈悲河口。平底船停在“石窟”附近的海面，大家都往“花岗石宫”的软梯跑去
可是这时候托普突然愤怒地狂叫起来，纳布正在找梯子，也突然喊了一声。
梯子不见了！
Book 2 Chapter 6
Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions searched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have moved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen down.... But the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if a squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was impossible in the dark.
"If it is a joke," cried Pencroft, "it is a very stupid one! To come home and find no staircase to go up to your room by--that's nothing for weary men to laugh at."
Neb could do nothing but cry out "Oh! oh! oh!"
"I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!" said Pencroft.
"Curious?" replied Gideon Spilett, "not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be more natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of our dwelling and drawn up the ladder."
"Some one," cried the sailor. "But who?"
"Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?" replied the reporter.
"Well, if there is any one up there," replied Pencroft, who began to lose patience, "I will give them a hail, and they must answer."
And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged "Halloo!" which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.
The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.
There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic of men, and the settlers were not men of that description. In their situation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the seven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met with anything of so surprising a character.
Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think, not knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of a satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more unlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they had had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them.
"My friends," at last said Cyrus Harding, "there is only one thing to be done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances. But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if we cannot eat, we can at least sleep."
"But who is it that has played us this cool trick?" again asked Pencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.
Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and when Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The brave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.
To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on the sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened, whether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at the return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human being; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be helped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling was occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.
Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse. There were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments, tools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their uneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to see if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his habitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to gain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this respect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.
"It is a joke," said Pencroft; "it is a trick some one has played us. Well, I don't like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him."
As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists, suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters of which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.
All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open.
Some one had entered Granite House--there could be no more doubt about that.
The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing, was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard themselves against a surprise.
Pencroft hailed again.
No reply.
"The beggars," exclaimed the sailor. "There they are sleeping quietly as if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands, robbers, sons of John Bull!"
When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of "son of John Bull," he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.
The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm.
The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able to escape. But how were they to be got at?
Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the communication between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might succeed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft fastened this to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.
Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his shoulder and covered the door.
The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed between the two last rounds.
The operation had succeeded.
Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out between the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite House.
"The rascals!" shouted the sailor. "If a ball can do anything for you, you shall not have long to wait for it.
"But who was it?" asked Neb.
"Who was it? Didn't you see?"
"No."
"It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the ladder during our absence."
And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor's words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows, from which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.
"I knew that it was only a joke," cried Pencroft; "but one of the jokers shall pay the penalty for the rest."
So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the monkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged to the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who are so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert declared it to be an orangoutang.
"What a magnificent beast!" cried Neb.
"Magnificent, if you like," replied Pencroft; "but still I do not see how we are to get into our house."
"Herbert is a good marksman," said the reporter, "and his bow is here. He can try again."
"Why, these apes are so cunning," returned Pencroft; "they won't show themselves again at the windows and so we can't kill them; and when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--"
"Have patience," replied Harding; "these creatures cannot keep us long at bay."
"I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here," replied the sailor. "And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows are up there?"
It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing. Pencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did not think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how? this is what they were not able to say.
Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show themselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or a paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted by a gun- shot.
"Let us hide ourselves," at last said the engineer. "Perhaps the apes will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on all that may appear."
The engineer's orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad, the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position, but out of the monkeys' sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.
In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they roasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett and Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to watch under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their post.
Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed that they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that, terrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the noise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house or probably even into the store-room. And when they thought of the valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much recommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and there certainly was room for it.
"Decidedly it is too bad," said the reporter; "and the worst of it is, there is no way of putting an end to it."
"But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow," cried the sailor. "We could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is there no way of getting at them?"
"Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake," replied the engineer.
"Oh!" shouted the sailor, "and I never thought of that."
This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite House so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was, it is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately, Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have taken some time.
It was already past twelve o'clock, when the colonists, well armed and provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect Heights.
But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the dog barking furiously.
And all rushed down the bank again.
Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.
In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause, were trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window to another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to replace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps in their terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists, now being able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or killed, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest, throwing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite House.
At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then unroll and fall to the ground.
"Hullo!" cried the sailor, "this is queer!"
"Very strange!" murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.
"Take care, captain!" cried Pencroft, "perhaps there are still some of these rascals.
"We shall soon see," replied the engineer, without stopping however.
All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the threshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.
"Well now, and the ladder," cried the sailor; "who can the gentleman have been who sent us that down?"
But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.
"Ah, the robber!" cried Pencroft.
And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,--
"Spare him, Pencroft."
"Pardon this rascal?"
"Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!"
And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was difficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.
Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.
"There!" said Pencroft. "And what shall we make of him, now we've got him?"
"A servant!" replied Herbert.
The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent race could be turned to account.
The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is not much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an orangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor the stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed of an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at table, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon properly, and even drink wine . . . doing everything as well as the best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one of these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous servant.
The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad chest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.
"A handsome fellow!" said Pencroft; "if we only knew his language, we could talk to him."
"But, master," said Neb, "are you serious? Are we going to take him as a servant?"
"Yes, Neb," replied the engineer, smiling. "But you must not be jealous."
"And I hope he will make an excellent servant," added Herbert. "He appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He will soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him."
"And they will be," replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor against "the jokers."
Then, approaching the orang,--
"Well, old boy!" he asked, "how are you?"
The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.
"You wish to join the colony?" again asked the sailor. "You are going to enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?"
Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.
"And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?"
Third affirmative grunt.
"This conversation is slightly monotonous," observed Gideon Spilett.
"So much the better," replied Pencroft; "the best servants are those who talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give you no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are pleased with you."
Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor begged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be called Jupiter, and Jup for short.
And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.
赛勒斯•史密斯一言不发，站住了。他的伙伴们在黑暗中摸索着石壁，也许是软梯被风吹到旁边去了，也许它掉在地上……可是到处无影无踪。是不是一阵狂风把它吹到半截的平台上去了呢？这一点在黑暗中还无法证实。
“假如是开玩笑的话，”潘克洛夫喊道，“这也就太过火了，回到自己的家门口却找不到进屋去的梯子，对于累得要命的人来说，这可不是什么好玩的事！”
纳布无法可施，急得大叫大嚷。
“我现在才感到林肯岛上的怪事层出不穷！”潘克洛夫说。
“奇怪吗？”吉丁•史佩莱接口道，“一点儿也不奇怪，潘克洛夫，再自然也没有了。有人乘我们出去的时候占据了我们的房子，把软梯拉上去了。”
“有人，”水手喊道。“你说是谁？”
“除了放枪的那个猎人还有谁。”通讯记者接着说，“没有别的，算我们倒媚！”
“假如上面有人的话，”潘克洛夫开始不耐烦他说，“我喊他一声，他准会答应的。”
“喂！——”水手用霹雳似的声音拉长了这个字喊起来，峭壁和山石间不断传来回声。
他们侧耳静听，好象有一种咯咯的笑声，大家都猜不出它的由来。可是没有人回答潘克洛夫，他一再大声叫唤着，都没有用。
的确，即使是最麻木不仁的人，在这种情况下也会不寒而栗，何况他们还不是那样的人。在他们所处的环境中，每一件事都举足轻重，但是，从他们留居在荒岛上这七个月以来，的确还没有遇到过一件象这样的怪事。
虽然他们由于诧异而忘记了疲劳，然而他们还只能停留在“花岗石宫”下面，他们不知道应该怎样考虑，怎样行动，明知道他们之中谁也不会给自己一个满意的回答，大家还是互相询问，人人都胡乱地猜想，而且愈想愈离奇。纳布由于不能进厨房而感到遗憾，因为他们所带的粮食已经吃得干干净净，现在又没法补充了。
“朋友们，”赛勒斯•史密斯终于说，“现在只有一个办法，就是：等到天亮，然后见机行事。我们先回‘石窟’，安下身来，即使没有吃的，至少可以睡一觉。”
“可是谁在和我们开这么大的玩笑呢？”潘克洛夫又问了一遍，他犹犹豫豫地，不想离开这个地方。
不管是谁，最行得通的办法还是工程师的建议，到“石窟”去等天亮。在这期间，他们命令托普在“花岗石宫”的窗下看守，托普接到命令以后一声不响。于是这只勇敢的狗就留在悬崖脚下了，它的主人和它主人的伙伴们则在乱石丛中找地方安身。
这些人已经非常疲倦，然而如果认为他们能在“石窟”的沙石上面安眠的话，那就错了。这不仅因为他们急于想知道这是怎么一回事——是事出偶然，一到白天就能真象大自呢？还是有人在故意捉弄他们？——而且在那里睡也极不舒适。但是，不管怎样，他们的住所在当时是被霸占了，一时也没法进去。
“花岗石宫”不仅是他们的住所，同时还是他们的仓库。他们的全部武器、仪器、工具、火药、食粮等等都在那里。假如这一切都被洗劫一空，他们要从头做起，制造新武器和新工具的话，这个问题的确是相当严重的。他们焦急不安，每隔几分钟就有一个人去看托普是不是还好好地守在那里。只有赛勒斯•史密斯还象平时那样镇静地等待着，然而，面对着这种不可思议的事实，他那坚强的理智也发挥不出力量来了。同时，当他想到有一种说不出来的权威在他的左右——也许就在上面——的时候，他不禁恼恨起来。吉丁•史佩莱在这方面也有同感，于是他们两个人低声谈论起这莫名其妙的情况，这种情况把他们的智慧和已往的经验全难住了。这个岛上肯定有什么秘密，可是，怎样去揭穿它呢？赫伯特只会幻想，只爱向史密斯问长问短。纳布认为这是他主人的事，要不是怕伙伴们生气的话，这位好心肠的黑人满可以跟在“花岗石宫”里一样安安稳稳地睡一宿。最着急的是潘克洛夫，他简直气疯了。
一这是开玩笑，”潘克洛夫说，“是有人和我们捣蛋。我可不喜欢这种玩笑，这位开玩笑的人最好还是留神一些，假如一旦落到我手里的话，我就要他好看！”
一线曙光才从东方露出来，大家就马上武装起来，回到峭壁旁边的海岸上。朝阳直射着“花岗石宫”，一会儿就会把它照得通亮的。在早晨五点钟的时候，透过遮蔽的枝叶，可以看到紧闭着的窗户。
一切看来都很正常；可是他们出发的时候关好的门现在却敞开了，他们看见以后，不由失声大叫起来。
有人到“花岗石宫”里去过了——这是毫无疑问的。
上半段软梯向来是从门口挂到平台上的，现在还在那里挂着，可是下半段却被拉到齐门槛的地方去了。显然，这些侵略者想用这个方法来防止意外侵袭。
要弄清楚他们是什么样的人，究竟有多少人？这是不可能的，因为，到现在还没有一个人露面。
潘克洛夫又喊了一会儿。
没有人回答。
“该死的东西，”水手喊道。“他们安安静静地好象睡在自己家里似的。喂，你们这些强盗，土匪，海寇，约翰牛！”
潘克洛夫是一个美国人，当他骂到“约翰牛”的时候，他认为已经把对方污蔑到极点了。
现在太阳完全升起来了，阳光照亮整个“花岗石宫”的正面，可是里里外外都是鸦雀无声。
他们不知道“花岗石宫”里有没有人，然而从梯子的位置看来显然是有的，同时还可以肯定，不管这些人是谁，他们还没有逃走。可是，怎样才能把他们抓住呢？
赫伯特提议在箭上系一根绳子，然后把箭向门槛上挂下来的软梯上射去——射进软梯的第一个空档里面。这样他们就可以拽箭上的绳子，把软梯从门槛拉到地面上来，恢复地面和“花岗石官”的交通。除此以外，显然没有别的方法；假如射箭的本领好，这个方法是可能成功的。好在弓箭都在“石窟”里，他们还在那里找到一些很轻的木槿绳子。潘克洛夫把它系在一支上等的羽箭上。然后赫伯特就张弓搭箭，瞄准了软梯的下部。
赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布都后退了几步，这样假如窗口有什么东西出现的话，他们就可以一目了然了。通讯记者举起枪来，把枪托抵在肩窝上，枪口对准“花岗石宫”的门户。
赫伯特拉满弓，那支箭带着绳子直飞出去，正射进软梯的最后两档之间。
他们成功了。
赫伯特马上抓住绳子头，他正打算一下子把软梯拉下来，突然从门缝里伸出一只手来，一把抓住绳子，把它拉进“花岗石宫”去了。
“该死的东西！”水手喊道。“假如给你一颗子弹的话，你早就活不成了。”
“是谁呀？”纳布问道。
“谁？你没有瞧见吗？”
“没有。”
“是一只猴子，一只蜘蛛猿，一只猩猩，一只狒狒，一只大猩猩，一只猿猴。我们的住所成了猴窠了，它们趁我们不在的时候从梯子上爬进去的。”
这时候，仿佛要证明水手的话没有错似的，有两三只猴子在窗口露出脸来，它们打开窗户，向房屋的主人作了无数个鬼脸。
“我早知道是开玩笑了，”潘克洛夫喊道，“可是我们非杀一儆百不可。”
说完以后，水手就举起枪来，瞄准一只猴子放了一枪。一只猴子掉在沙滩上只剩下一口气，其余的都不见了。这只大猴子显然属于猕猴类的第一目。也许是黑猩猩，也许是猩猩，也许是大猩猩，总之，它属于类人猿，这是因为它们长得和人相似因而得名的，可是精通动物学的赫伯特却一口咬定这是一只猩猩。
“这个畜生长相多好啊！”纳布喊道。
“好就好吧，”潘克洛夫答道，“可是我看还是没法到屋子里去。”
“赫伯特是一个射击能手，”通讯记者说，“他的弓还在这儿。不妨再来试一下。”
“怎么，这些猴崽子可机灵了，”潘克洛夫说，“它们不会再到窗口来的，我们打不到它们了，我一想到它们如果在房间和仓库里耍起把戏来，就……”
“别着急，”史密斯说，“我们决不会被它们弄得毫无办法的。”
“它们不下来我真不敢相信，”水手说。“现在，史密斯先生，你知道上面有几打吗？”
潘克洛夫的问题很难回答，少年要想作第二次尝试也不容易，因为梯子的下部又被拉进了门里，下面拉第二把的时候，绳子就断了，软梯却还牢牢地留在原处。情况的确很令人为难。潘克洛夫急得暴跳如雷。从某一方面看起来，这个局面是很滑稽的，然而他却丝毫也不觉得可笑。自然，他们最后是会把侵略者赶出去，重新回到家里去的，可是这要等到什么时候呢：又该怎么办呢？困难就在这里。
两个钟头过去了，在这一段时间内，这些猴子小心翼翼，不敢露面，可是它们仍在里面不出来，有三四次门口和窗户上探出一个鼻子或爪子来，他们马上就给它一枪。
“我们躲起来吧，”工程师最后说。“也许它们认为我们去远了，会重新出来的。史佩莱和赫伯特埋伏在石头后面，一看见它们出来就打。”
大家马上就按照工程师的命令去们了，通讯记者和少年在这些人里射击技术最高明，他们找到一个不让猴子看见的地方躲起来，这时，纳布、潘克洛夫和赛勒斯爬上高地，到森林里打猎去了，因为现在已经是早饭的时候，他们连一点余粮也没有。
半个钟头以后，打猎的人带了一些野鸽子回来，他们尽可能把这些野鸽子烤得恰到好处。猴子还是一只也没有出来。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特把托普留在窗下，去吃早饭了。吃完以后，又回来继续埋伏着。
又过了两个钟头，他们的情况还是没有丝毫好转。猴子消声匿迹，好象已经失踪了似的，实际上它们也许是看到同伴被打死，恐惧起来，又害怕枪声，因此躲到房子的后半部，跑到仓库里去了。他们一想到仓库里所藏的珍贵东西，就急得跳起来，连工程师一再嘱咐的耐心也不顾了，这并不是没有原因的。
“真糟糕，”通讯记者说，“最麻烦的是：它闹起来没完没了，我们竟毫无办法。”
“可是我们总得想个法子把这些畜生赶出去，”水手喊道。“即使它们有二十个，我们也可以很快地制伏它们的，不过这就必须和它们面对面地干一场。来吧，难道没法抓住它们吗？”
“我们想法子从原来湖边的那个洞口到‘花岗石宫’里去吧。”工程师说。
“啊！真糊涂！”水手喊道，“我怎么会没想到。”
的确，这是到“花岗石宫”里去，跟这群侵略者打仗和把它们赶出去的唯一办法了。不错，洞口已经被石头和泥土筑成的墙堵住了，现在只有作一次牺牲，但这是很容易修补起来的。幸亏还没有按照赛勒斯•史密斯的计划，把湖水引到高处来淹没洞口，要不然就要多费一些时间了。
他们带着武器，拿了锄头和铲子离开“石窟”，经过“花岗石宫”的窗下，这时候已经十二点多钟了；他们把托普留在原地，然后爬上慈悲河左边的堤岸，往眺望岗走去。
可是他们朝着这个方向走了还不到五十步，就听见托普怒吠起来。
于是大家又从河堤上冲下去。
他们一转弯就发现情况变了。
一大群猿猴不知为什么突然受了惊，正打算逃走。有两三只从一个窗口往另外一个窗口爬去，灵活得象杂技演员似的。其实把梯子放回原处就很容易下来，它们却根本没有打算这么做，大概惊慌得晕头转向，它们已经忘记可以这样逃跑了。现在这些居民们瞄准起来毫不困难，于是他们开枪射击。许多猿猴，死的死，伤的伤，一阵叫喊，都跌到房间里去了。其他往外冲的，跌在地上，摔得粉身碎骨，几分钟以后，居民们估计“花岗石宫”里一只活猴也没有了。
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫大喊起好来。
“不要喊这么多好，行不行！”史佩莱说。
“为什么？”水手说，“它们都被杀光了。”
“我同意，”通讯记者说，“但是，空喊好还是不能进屋子的。”
“那么，我们还是到水洞口去吧！”潘克洛夫说。
“对！”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“但是最好还是……”
这时候，仿佛是回答史密斯的话似的，只见一条软梯从门槛上滑了下来，一直挂到地上。
“啊！”水手一面望着史密斯，一面喊道，“真奇怪！”
“真奇怪！”工程师喃喃地说，他首先跳上梯子。
“留神，史密斯先生！”潘克洛夫大声说，“这些该死的畜生也许还没有死光呢……”
“我们马上就可以知道了，”史密斯一面回答，一面还是继续往上爬。
大家都跟在他的后面，一会儿他们就来到门前了。他们到处搜索。但是一个人也没有，在这群猴子“光临”过的仓库里同样也没有一个人。
“那么，梯子，”水子喊道，“是哪位大爷给我们送下来的呢？”
这时候只听得一声大喊，接着就有一只很大的猩猩——它原先是躲在走廊里的——冲到屋子里来，纳布在后面紧紧地追赶着。
“啊，你这个强盗！”潘克洛夫喊道。
他手拿着利斧，正打算往猩猩的脑袋上劈去，赛勒斯•史密斯一把抓住他的胳膊，说：
“留下它吧，潘克洛夫。”
“饶了这个畜生？”
“是的！梯子是它扔给我们的！”
工程师的语气非常奇怪，使人听了以后简直不知道他说的是真话还是假话。
可是大家还是扑在猩猩的身上，它勇敢地自卫着，但很快就抵挡不住，被捆起来了。
“得！”潘克洛夫说，“现在已经捉住了，我们该怎么处置它呢？”
“当我们的仆人！”赫伯特答道。
少年并不是开玩笑，因为他知道，这种聪明的动物是可以加以利用的。
于是大家来到猿猴的近旁仔细端详它。它是类人猿的一种，类人猿的颜面角和澳洲、南非的土人比起来并不见得相差很远。这是一只猩猩，它既不象大猩猩那样凶猛可怕，又不象狒狒那样常常会轻举妄动；既不象南美洲长尾猿那样肮脏，也不象北非叟猴那样暴躁，更不象犬面狒狒那样本性恶劣。类人猿中有一种类型具有许多特点，证明它们的智慧几乎是和人相等的，这只猩猩正是属于这一个类型。如果在家里留用的话，它们可以伺候人、扫地、洗衣服、擦皮鞋，会规规矩矩地使用刀、叉、汤匙，甚至还能喝酒……做什么事情都能和久经训练的仆人一样。标丰也有一只这样的猩猩，很久以来，一直象他的一个忠实而热心的仆人。
在“花岗石宫”里捉住的这只猩猩个子非常大，有六英尺高，体格匀称美观，胸膛宽阔，头颅不大不小，颜面角达六十五度，脑壳圆圆的，鼻子向外突出，长着一身光亮而柔软的毛，总之，这是一只优良品种的类人猿。它的眼睛虽然比人的小一些，却露出智慧的光芒，雪白的牙齿在胡髭下闪闪发光，此外，它的下巴底下还长着一小撮褐色的卷须。
“真漂亮！”潘克洛夫说，“假如我们懂得它的话，就可以和它交谈了。”
“可是，主人，”纳布说，“真的吗？我们真的要收它当仆人吗？”
“是的，纳布，”工程师笑道。“你可别嫉妒。”
“我相信它会伺候得很好的，”赫伯特又加了一句。“它看起来很年轻，很容易教导，我们不必用强力压制它，也不必象有些人那样，拔掉它的牙齿。只要待它好一些，它很快就会爱护它的主人的。”
“会的。”潘克洛夫说，他对“开玩笑的人”的愤怒早忘得一干二净了。
于是他走到猩猩前面。
“老兄！”他问道，“你好吗？”
猩猩哼了一声，却没有什么怒意。
“你愿意加入我们的小队吗？”水手接着问道。“你愿意为赛勒斯•史密斯先生服务吗？”
猩猩又哼了一声，表示回答。
“待遇是一日三餐，别的没有了，你满意吗？”
它第三次肯定地哼了一声。
“这样谈话未免大简单了。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“简单些好，”潘克洛夫说，“最好的仆人该是沉默寡言。没有待遇，听见吗，伙计？我们先不给你待遇，可是将来假如认为你还不错的话，那时候再加倍。”
于是小队里就新添了一个成员了。在给它起名字的时候，水手提出一项要求：为了纪念他过去所认识的一只猿猴起见，他请求叫它朱波德，简称杰普。
就这样，没有经过其他仪式，小杰普就在“花岗石宫”里住下来了。
Book 2 Chapter 7
The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore spared the trouble of mason's work. It was certainly lucky, that at the moment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction? This was the only explanation of their sudden retreat.
During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although they had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken nothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.
Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds and rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they were more sure of his submission.
Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most pressing. The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern part of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture.
These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their clothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy the transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply them with winter clothes.
As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding's intention to establish it at the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and abundant pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the first, the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it.
But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far from Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to which Neb called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary that the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place appeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard than that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old opening.
Water-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple of tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be domesticated.
The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the construction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this important task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the settlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore.
There Pencroft observed,--
"Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?"
"Let us tie its lower end down firmly," replied Cyrus Harding.
This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then the settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the angle formed by the river.
There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown across. The place appeared suitable.
In fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on the southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a half, and from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good cart-road which would render the communication between Granite House and the south of the island extremely easy.
Cyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely isolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of quadrupeds and quadrumana. In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the poultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used for cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals. Nothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how the engineer intended to set to work.
The plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either artificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant, from the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the lake for the escape of the water.
On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above and below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern border by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the Mercy.
Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the bridge was to be established.
The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile, which was open to all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a broad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow of which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy. The level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh discharge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the volume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the execution of this project.
"So then," added the engineer, "Prospect Heights will become a regular island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw across the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and below the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be constructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across to the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if these bridges can be raised at will, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise."
The bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down, stripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be firm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are managed.
This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully conducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty feet wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads.
Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor of iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a marvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions, who in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of their tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself. "Who would ever have expected so much from a newspaper man!" thought Pencroft.
The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the weather being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep.
During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed to his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very inquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not as yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the limits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works. Top and Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did everything solemnly.
On the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part, balanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was needed to rise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which it rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was sufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing.
The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be necessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to beat a road through the dense forests of the Far West. This would take some time. Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state of things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would suffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that the work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.
"That," observed Pencroft, "will enable us to establish our poultry-yard under better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes nor the attacks of other beasts."
"Then," added Neb, "we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants to it."
"And prepare our second corn-field!" cried the sailor with a triumphant air.
In fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered admirably, thanks to Pencroft's care. It had produced the ten ears foretold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the colony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six months, which promised a double harvest each year.
These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved, were to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed on the single grain.
The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and pointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to birds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft's ingenious brain, were enough to frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very regular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest.
On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was to close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to the angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable earth, and below that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed work. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep, was dug out in the hard ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream, to which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an affluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the lake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand supported by means of stakes.
By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished, and Prospect Heights--that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon, having a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid belt--was completely protected from depredators of every description.
During the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it, however, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to possess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.
It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been completed, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his masters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though very powerful and wonderfully active. He was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.
The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the southeastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and in it were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to populate it. These were simply built of branches and divided into compartments, made ready for the expected guests.
The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number of young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to the borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which the wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage rival the golden pheasants. A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers, magnificent alectors, which soon became tame. As to pelicans, kingfishers, water-hens, they came of themselves to the shores of the poultry-yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing, screaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging proportion for the future use of the colony.
Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a pigeon- house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a dozen of those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds soon became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling, and showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their congeners, the wood- pigeons.
Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas, above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be thought of.
It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more manageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to be found.
But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.
"Certainly," said Pencroft, "a beast of burden would be very useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a branch line to Mount Franklin!"
One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise. The settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious incident.
What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape, dove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head and neck. They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future masters.
"These are onagers!" cried Herbert, "animals something between the zebra and the quagga!"
"Why not donkeys?" asked Neb.
"Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!"
"Donkeys or horses," interrupted Pencroft, "they are 'moving powers,' as the captain would say, and as such must be captured!"
The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass to the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were prisoners.
Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No. It was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam freely about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the engineer immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard, in which the onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter during the night.
This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to terrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains and forests. They were then seen following the water-barrier which everywhere presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then galloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain entire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!
In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and some days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready, but a straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the forests of the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon. The cart might then be driven there, and towards the end of December they tried the onagers for the first time.
Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand, and they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once harnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it was not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager, being less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness in the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.
On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals' heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.
Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and rigging of the balloon.
At eight o'clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach. The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House.
林肯岛上的这群居民没有被迫打开原有的洞口进房子，现在又从老路回到家里来了，他们因此省掉一番充当泥水匠的麻烦。正当他们打算去打开洞口的时期，猿猴们突然莫名其妙地受了惊吓，自己从“花岗石宫”里逃出来，这的确是他们的运气。猴子们发现他们要转移阵地来进攻自己了吗？这是唯一能够说明它们退却的理由。
他们乘白天把猿猴的尸体带到丛林里去，埋了起来，然后他们就忙着恢复被这群侵略者所搞乱的秩序——仅仅是混乱，而不是破坏，因为它们虽然把屋子搅得天翻地覆，却没有损坏任何东西。纳布又燃起了炉火，好在食品室里的储藏很丰富，人人都饱餐了一顿。
他们也没有忘记杰普，给了它许多南欧松子和块茎，它吃得津津有味。潘克洛夫把它前肢的束缚松开了，可是觉得后肢还是绑着的好，等它听话一些再说。
吃完饭，在睡觉以前，史密斯和他的伙伴们就围着桌子坐下来讨论计划了，这些计划需要赶快执行。最重要和最迫切的问题就是在慈悲河上搭一座桥，建立起荒岛南岸和“花岗石宫”之间的交通；然后造一个围栏，预备驯养他们所打算捕捉的摩弗仑羊和其他毛用动物。
这两个计划可以帮助他们解决当前严重的穿衣问题。搭起桥梁以后，就很容易把气球运来，那时候他们就可以得到布，围栏里的动物可以供给他们兽毛，用来做冬衣穿。
赛勒斯•史密斯打算把围栏设在红河的发源地附近，因为那里有反刍动物所需要的大量新鲜牧草。从眺望岗到红河发源地，有一段已经践踏成道路；假如有一辆比原来好一些的大车，特别是假如他们能捉到一些兽类来拉车的话，把东西运到这儿来就非常容易了。
纳布特别向大家提出一个问题，他认为围栏离“花岗石宫”这么远倒还不要紧，可是家禽场离这么远就不成了。当然，鸟类是必须离厨房近一些的，要建立这样的家禽场，除了靠近原来洞口的那一段湖岸以外，似乎再也找不到更合适的地方了。
在那里，不但可以繁育一般鸟类，而且还可以繁育水禽；他们首先要把在上次狩猎途中所捉到的鹌鹑养驯。
第二天，11月3日，新的造桥工程开始了，人人都要参加这项重要的工作。居民们现在一下子都变成木工，扛着锯、斧头和锤子，从河岸上走下去。
潘克洛夫忽然说：
“昨天多亏小杰普把梯子还给了我们，可是今天我们出去的时候，它会不会又想坏主意把梯子拿上去呢？”
“我们把梯子的下面紧紧地绑住。”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。
他们在沙地上牢牢地钉了两个木桩，把软梯缚住。然后就爬上了慈悲河的左岸，很快地来到河口拐角的地方。
他们停下来，考虑这里能不能架桥。这个地点似乎很合适。
从这里到前一天在南部海滨发现的气球港只有三英里半，在桥梁和气球港之间很容易开辟一条适于大车通行的道路，使“花岗石宫”和荒岛的南部之间有极便利的交通线。
赛勒斯•史密斯向他的伙伴们提出一个方案，要把整个眺望岗孤立起来，使野兽和猿猴都到不了这里。这样，“花岗石宫”、“石窟”、家禽场和耕种用的整个上半部高地都可以免得遭到它们的劫掠了。这个计划实行起来再容易也没有了，工程师就打算这样着手进行工作。
高地的三面已经有水围住了，有的是人工开掘的，有的是天然的。西北方是格兰特湖岸——从甬道的入口处，直到湖岸上排水的缺口。
北边从湖岸的缺口直到海边，是一条新的水道，这条水道在瀑布源头的上下两端，经过高地和岸边自己冲出一条河床来，只要把这条小河的河床稍微挖深一些，就可以把兽类隔绝在外边了，至于东部全境，从上述小河的河口到慈悲河口，则有大海作为屏障。
最后，南边是慈悲河——从河口到拐角（也就是计划搭桥的地方）的一段。
现在只剩下高地的西边可以通行了，这一段从河流的拐弯到格兰特湖的南角之间相隔约有一英里。可是最简便的办法还是挖一条又宽又深的沟渠，这条沟渠可以用湖水把它灌满，一旦湖水过多，就可以通过沟渠很快地流到慈悲河去。湖水骤然排出以后，湖面肯定就要降低一些了；赛勒斯•史密斯已经证实了红河的水量相当大，足够用来实现这项计划。
“这样一来，”工程师说，“眺望岗周围都是水，就成为一个正式的岛屿了，要想和我们岛上的其他领土联系，只能通过桥，一座是我们打算搭在慈悲河上的；此外两座小桥，一座在瀑布以上，一座在瀑布以下，都已搭好了；最后我们还要造两座小桥，一座造在我计划开凿的运河上，另外一座通往慈悲河的左岸。假如这些桥能随心所欲地吊起来的话，眺望岗就可以安如磐石了。”
为了使伙伴们了解得更清楚，赛勒斯•史密斯画了一幅眺望岗高地的详图。这幅图使大家明白了他的计划，于是大家一致表示赞成。潘克洛夫挥舞着斧头，大声叫道：
“我们先去修桥吧！”
修桥是目前最迫切的工程。他们砍伐选好的树木，除去杈枝，做成横梁、托架和厚板。这座桥，在慈悲河右岸的一头是固定的，可是在左岸的一头却是活动的，可以象某些运柯的吊桥一样，利用均衡锤吊起来。
这项工程当然是相当艰巨的，虽然领导有方，还是花了不少的时间，因为慈悲河在这里宽达八十英尺。必须在河床中打下一些桥桩，才能支撑桥板，为了打桩，就必须安装打桩机。桥桩应该形成两个弓架结构，使桥身能够承受重量。
幸亏木工用具、金属的安装工具和这方面的专门人才都不缺少，伙伴们的热情也很高。经过七个月的实际锻炼，他们在使用工具上已经有了高度的技术。必须说明，吉丁•史佩莱的技术也非常熟练，他的灵巧程度几乎跟水手不相上下，潘克洛夫想道：“一个记者竟能这样，真想不到！”
他们艰苦而有规律地进行了三个星期的劳动，才完成了慈悲河上的桥梁工程。他们甚至连吃早饭也在工地上吃，由于天气很好，只有吃晚饭的时候才回“花岗石宫”。
在这期间，小杰普对它的新主人逐渐熟悉了，它总是好奇地望着他们的一举一动。可是为了谨慎起见，潘克洛夫还没有完全解除它的束缚，他考虑得很正确，必须等到高地界河的计划工程完成以后，才允许它自由。托普和杰普相处得很好，它们很愿意在一起玩，可是杰普不论做什么都是一本正经的。
11月20日，桥梁完工了。桥身的活动部分由于有均衡锤的作用，很容易悬吊，只要稍微用一些气力，就可以把它升起来，枢纽和最后一根横木（当桥落下的时候，就用它来支撑）之间相隔二十英尺，任何动物也跳不过来。
现在居民们开始谈论搬运气球的问题了，他们急于要把它放在一个万无一失的地方，可是假如要搬运，就必须拉着大车到气球港去，要拉大车，就必须在远西森林中开辟出一条路来。这需要有相当长的时间才行。纳布和潘克洛夫到气球港去视察了一下，回来以后说，藏在石头洞中的布是不会损坏的，于是大家决定还是不要停止眺望岗的工作。
潘克洛夫说，“既然不怕狐狸和其它野兽上这儿来，我们就可以安心地开辟家禽场了。”
“那么，”纳布加上一句，“我们就可以开出一块高地来，把野生植物移种到那里去。”
“准备我们的第二块麦田！”水手得意洋洋地喊道。
的确，第一块麦田里那棵唯一的庄稼，在潘克洛夫的小心照料之下，长得很好。工程师说过可以结十个麦穗，现在已经结出来了，每个麦穗有八十颗麦粒，六个月的工夫他们就得到八百颗麦粒了，因此他们每年能够收获两次。
这八百颗麦粒，除了拿出五十颗珍藏起来以外，都打算用来种在一片新开垦的地里，他们决定要和过去照料那个单株一样小心地去照料它们。
耕地的准备工作做好以后，他们又在周围造了一道结实的栅栏，栅栏不仅很高，而且顶端都削尖了，一般的走兽是很难跳进来的。至于飞鸟，在潘克洛夫天才的设计下，用木板做了几个人体模型和发出响声的风车就可以把它们吓走。他们把这七百五十颗麦粒种在整齐的畦垅里，然后听凭大自然去摆布。
11月21日，赛勒斯•史密斯开始设计运河工程了，这条运河将要把高地与西边分隔开来，也就是从格兰特湖的南角直到慈悲河拐弯的地方。这里的地面有两三英尺深是腐植土，下面就是花岗石了，因此必须再制造一些硝化甘油。硝化甘油照例起了作用。不到两个星期，就在高地的坚硬地面上开了一条十二英尺宽、六英尺深的沟渠。他们又用同样的方法在岩石的湖岸上开了一条沟渠，从湖里引出水来，形成一条小河，他们把这条小河命名为甘油河，成了慈悲河的支流。正如工程师事先所说的那样，湖面降低了，不过降得很少。为了把高地周围全用河流包围起来，他们把海滩上的河床适当地加宽，同时用木桩隔开泥沙。
到十二月中旬，这些工程都完毕了，眺望岗——它成了一个不规则的五边形，周围将近四英里，流水象一条带子似的环绕着它——现在完全不伯盗贼的侵扰了。
十二月的时候，天气正热。可是居民们继续工作，由于他们急于想建立一个家禽场，就立刻动起手来。
自从高地的隔离工程完成以后，不用说，杰普就恢复自由了。它没有离开它的主人，而且根本没有逃跑的意思。它很温和，气力又大，而且惊人地矫捷。你看，它爬起“花岗石宫”的梯子来，真是谁也比不上。经过人们的教养，它已经能够拉木料，把甘油河里的石头成车地运走了。
“它还不能算是一个泥水匠，但已经是一只猴子了！”赫伯特开玩笑地说。“猴子”这个外号，原是泥水匠用来称呼自己的徒弟的。这个外号可说是再恰当也没有了。
家禽场占地二百平方码，在格兰特湖的东南岸。它由一道栅栏围着，里面有各种供飞鸟繁殖的窝棚。这些窝棚都是用树枝构造的，分隔成许多单间，随时可以供新来的客人居住。
头一个住进来的就是那一对鹌鹑，它们不久就孵出许多小鹌鹑来了；和它们住在一起的还有一打鸭子，这些鸭子惯于住在格兰特湖边。其中有些是中国种，它们张开翅膀就好象扇子似的，羽毛光彩艳丽，可以和锦鸡媲美。几天以后，赫伯特套住一对鹑鸡，它们的尾毛很长，向外张开；这是一种美丽的野鸽子，很快就养驯了。至于塘鹅，鱼狗，大鷭，它们都是自动到家禽场的岸边来的，这个小小的集体唧唧喳喳地吵叫一番以后，也就安稳地住下来了，它们的数目增长得非常快，小队可以不愁没有食用的了。
赛勒斯•史密斯为了完美起见，又在家禽场的一角建立了一个鸽棚。他养了一打常到高地岩石上来的鸽子。它们很快就住熟了，每天早出晚归，比起同类的斑鸠来，它们要好养得多。
终于到了该利用气球做衬衫和其他东西的时候了。至于要保持气球的原状，吹足了气，冒险渡过无边无际的大海回家去，只有无法生存下去的人，可能有这种打算，而实事求是的赛勒斯•史密斯连想也没想。
必须把气球的气囊运往“花岗石宫”，大家都想办法要使他们的大车减轻一些分量而易于驾驭。虽然他们有一辆车，可是还没有办法解决拉车的动力问题。
难道荒岛上没有一种动物能够代替马、驴或牛的吗？这是一个问题。
“当然，”潘克洛夫说，“目前牲口对我们还很有用，日后史密斯先生会制造蒸气大车，甚至要造火车头的，将来火车可以从‘花岗石宫’直达气球港，支线通往富兰克林山！”
纯朴的水手完全相信自己所说的话。你看：当幻想里加入了信念的时候，它的力量有多么大呀！
平心说，只要有一头拉车的牲口，就能做完潘克洛夫所有的事了。的确，老天爷特别宠爱他，并没有使他失望。
12月23日那一天，纳布和托普突然大喊大叫起来，显然他们都在尽量叫喊。居民们正在“石窟”里忙着，以为出了什么事情，赶快跑了出来。
他们看见了什么？原来是两只驯良的大牲口乘桥通着的时候冒冒失失地闯到高地上来了。人们可能会把它们当做马，至少是驴子，一公一母，长得很匀称，浑身是淡灰色的，腿部和尾巴雪白，头部、颈部以及全身有着黑色的条纹。它们稳步地向前走来，一点儿也不惊慌，瞪着眼看着人们，现在它们还不知道这些人就是自己未来的主人呢。
“是野驴！”赫伯特喊道，“一种介乎斑驴和斑马之间的牲口！”
“难道不是驴子吗？”纳布问道。
“因为它们耳朵不长，长相也比驴子要漂亮些！”
“驴也好，马也好，”潘克洛夫插嘴说，“反正是史密斯先生所说的‘动力’，必须把它逮住！”
水手悄悄地从草中爬到甘油河的桥上去，把桥板拉起来，于是这两只野驴就成为俘虏了。
现在需要用暴力抓住它们，强制驾驭它们吗，不，他们决定先让野驴自由自在地在高地上呆几天，反正这里有着大量的牧草；工程师立刻着手在家禽场旁边修建一个牲口棚，里面预备下野驴的饲料，垫上干草，好让它们晚上在里面过夜。
工作完毕了，他们让这两头漂亮的牲口行动完全自由，甚至避免走近它们，以防它们受惊。野驴有好几次对于长时间留在这里出不去表示不耐烦，很想离开高地远走，因为兽类是惯于生活在原野上和森林间的。居民们只见野驴沿着到处阻拦着它们的河水徘徊，发一阵短促的叫喊声，在草地里跳了一会，最后终于安稳下来，它们有时候还呆呆地望着那一片丛林。它们今后再也不能旧地重游了！
在这期间，他们又利用植物纤维制造了一套挽具。野驴来后不多天，不仅大车做好了，而且还在远西森林中笔直地开辟了一条道路——说得更恰当一些，是一条便道——从慈悲河的拐角直通气球港，大车可以驶过去。十二月底，他们第一次试驾野驴。
潘克洛夫已经能使牲口来吃他手里的东西，走到它们的身边它们也不跑了，可是一套上挽具，它们就直立起来，很难勒住。然而不久它们对这种新的差事也就顺从了，因为野驴不象斑马那样倔强，南非的山区里常常用它来作为动力，甚至在欧洲较冷的地区，它们也能适应。
这一天，全体队员都上了大车，潘克洛夫一个人在前面带领着牲口，沿着道路直往气球港走去。
当然，在这条坎坷不平的道路上，是难免要颠簸的，可是大车还是平安无事地到达了气球港，而且很快就装上了气球的气囊和绳索。
当天晚上八点钟，大车回来了，通过慈悲河上的桥，下了左边的堤岸，停在海滩上。他们解开野驴的疆绳，把它们牵到牲口棚里去。潘克洛夫在临睡以前，兴奋得大吼一声，整个的“花岗石宫”都震动了。
Book 2 Chapter 8
The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen garments required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used by sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn was sewn firmly.
There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding's idea of re- employing that which had been already used in the covering of the balloon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it irritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part of the business. Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring.
The cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means of soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a way that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural softness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere, it soon became perfectly white. Some dozen shirts and sock--the latter not knitted, of course, but made of cotton--were thus manufactured. What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean linen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled about that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the couches at Granite House into quite comfortable beds!
It was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which were greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America. We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched the feet of the wearers.
With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but the hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries, capybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot uselessly.
Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in the box, and which he wished to reserve for the future. How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare for the unknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it some easily renewable substance.
To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he employed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets, not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each charge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this deficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make that also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but this preparation requires extreme care, and without special tools it is difficult to produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore, to manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may be used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton, but in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the elder, etc. Now, the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek, and the colonists had already made coffee of the berries of these shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.
The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only fuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal, had already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the saltpeter with which nature supplied him. He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences, that is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive inflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous deflagration which might damage the firearms. On the other hand, the advantages of pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp, that it does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four times that of ordinary powder.
To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid for a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing could be more simple.
Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not the fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits white vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting for the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from three to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer obtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore soon had a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced admirable results.
About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and the rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers. Several excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of the Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of wild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful culture would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which the settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal were also carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving the roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.
The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House. As fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine, its inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made plantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and furnished excellent molluscs. Besides that, the fishing, either in the lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some lines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine trout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow, and which were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was skilled in the culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of fare. Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has been said, they felt this privation greatly.
The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of Cape Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little mounds, concealing perfectly spherical turtles' eggs, with white hard shells, the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds' eggs. They were hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as each turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.
"A regular egg-field," observed Gideon Spilett, "and we have nothing to do but to pick them up."
But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after the producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back to Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable from an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup, flavored with aromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb.
We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores for the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and ascended the country for several miles. It was the time at which the females, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the males and make a great noise through the fresh water. A thousand of these fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up the river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across the stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and stored for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render fishing impracticable. By this time the intelligent Jup was raised to the duty of valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen breeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight. The clever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have said that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked together. Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned it. When his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he saw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master.
Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite House when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one day, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he acquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes, pouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to the settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft.
"Jup, some soup!"
"Jup, a little agouti!"
"Jup, a plate!"
"Jup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!"
Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted, replied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a knowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said to him,--
"Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled."
It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at Granite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest without showing any wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him walking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried on his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to gather some fruit from the summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the wheel of the cart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of his shoulder put it right again.
"What a jolly fellow he is!" cried Pencroft often. "If he was as mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!"
It was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in the center of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be established near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount Franklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have been troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who were to supply the wool for the settlers' winter garments.
Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented only by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the Creek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road to which the name of Corral Road had been given.
There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the mountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of trees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and it was not too much shaded by the trees which grew about it. This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to contain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they might produce.
The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were brought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the ground.
The construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks, for besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the animals could take shelter. These buildings had also to be made very strong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be feared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire, had been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props assured the solidity of the whole.
The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented by the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful summer's day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well trained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.
The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and gradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, Neb, and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while the two cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral.
The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine animals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of the ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair.
This hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running and riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded, more than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and ten wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open door of which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and were prisoners.
In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to complain. There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at no distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant.
That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted. However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day to visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming more tranquil.
During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The daily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the roads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which, starting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast. The yet unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered Serpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon Spilett was so anxious to clear their domain.
Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given to the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from the forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion without bringing home some useful vegetable. One day, it was some specimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an excellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic qualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers, which have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of which more than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden, now well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided into small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips, radishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau was particularly fertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.
They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did not demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to complain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the roots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from the young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled and fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans spring- beer.
Towards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of a couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species, characterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose upper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage; and also some magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks, the comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So far, everything had succeeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent men. Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them.
After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work was finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers, which Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they instructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of the sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign.
They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What was the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly prolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General Grant. The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the last action of this terrible struggle. Now the North had triumphed in the good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in Lincoln Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the rest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which the balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable lives from the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of their captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists, furnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn to their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is to say, the three kingdoms of Nature.
Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.
As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to his companions more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled at Herbert's ideas or Pencroft's nonsense, but always and everywhere he pondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which the secret still escaped him!
他们在一月份的第一个礼拜赶制了队里所需要的衣服。所用的针都是箱子里的，他们的手虽然不巧，却很有力，我们可以肯定，做出来的活儿是很牢固的。
居民们并不缺少线。多亏赛勒斯•史密斯的倡议，他们用气球上的旧线，解决了缝纫上的问题。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特以惊人的耐心把它们全拆了下来，潘克洛夫则感到这项工作对于他简直是不能容忍，于是就半途而废了，可是在缝纫方面却是谁也比不上他。的确，水手们擅长缝纫，这是谁都知道的。
他们从焚烧植物的灰里取得小苏打和钾碱，用来洗净气囊的布料，经过洗涤以后，棉布上的油漆都脱落了，恢复了它原有的柔软和弹性，晾干以后，它就洁白如新了。他们缝制出好几打衬衫和袜套来——当然，这些袜套不是针织的，而是棉布做的。这群居民换上了干净的布衣，他们感到多么的舒适啊！固然这些布料相当粗，然而他们却毫不介意，同时他们感觉也有了被单，这些被单顿时使“花岗石宫”的睡榻变成舒适的床铺了！
也是在这个时候，他们还制造了一批海豹皮靴，从美国穿来的那些靴子现在已经非换不行了。这些新靴子做得非常宽大，决不会挤痛他们的脚。
现在已经是1866年，年初的时候天气很热，可是他们仍然到森林里打猎。这里到处都是刺鼠、野猪、水豚、袋鼠和其它各种兽类，史佩莱和赫伯特的射击技术十分高明，真是百发百中。
赛勒斯•史密斯仍旧要求大家节省火药，他尽量想法子用别的东西代替，把那箱子里的弹药，留到将来再用。在伙伴们和自己离开这块领地以前，谁能预料会发生什么事呢？因此，他们应该为了这不可知的前途节省火药，尽量使用容易补充的代用品。
史密斯在岛上找不到铅，于是他用铁粒来代替，这是很容易制造的。既然铁弹没有铅弹沉重，他就只好把它们做得大一些，少装一些火药。这样虽然效力稍差，可是由于射击者的技术好，却弥补了这个缺点。至于火药，赛勒斯•史密斯本来也能制造，因为他有的是硝石、硫磺和木炭，可是这项工作必须特别小心，没有特殊的工具很难保证质量。于是史密斯决定还是制造棉花火药，也就是火棉，这种东西并不是非要棉花不可，凡是植物纤维都可以用，大麻和亚麻、纸张、接骨木树心等的纤维，都和棉花的纤维一样纯净。荒岛的红河河口一带生长着大量的接骨木：这种灌木属于忍冬科的植物，移民们已经用它的果实制造过咖啡了。
唯一需要收集的就是接骨木的树心，至于制造棉花火药的其他必需品，就是发烟硝酸。现在史密斯手头有硫酸，只要加入硝石，就很容易地取得硝酸，而硝石又是可以从自然界取得的。于是他决定生产棉花火药以供使用，可是它有一些缺点，就是效果拿不稳，容易燃烧——它不是在240度，而是在170度就自燃——枪枝很容易因走火而损坏。另一方面，棉花火药也有它的优点，那就是：不怕受潮，不会弄脏枪筒，而且力量相当于普通火药的四倍。
制造棉花火药只要把棉花在发烟硝酸里浸一刻钟，然后在冷水里洗净晾干。没有比这个更简单的了。
赛勒斯•史密斯手头只有普通的硝酸而没有发烟硝酸或是硝酸单水化合物，也就是说，他的这种硝酸一碰到潮湿的空气就会冒白烟，于是工程师在普通的硝酸里掺了三倍至五倍的浓硫酸，也就得到了同样的效果。于是岛上的猎人很快就有了大量的火药，由于使用谨慎，效果也很好。
到这时候为止，他们在高地上已经开拓了三英亩的土地，其余的部分为了照顾野驴的缘故，还保留着草地。他们到啄木鸟林和远西森林去了好几次，从那里带回来大量的野菜、菠菜、水芹、萝卜和芜菁，这些菜蔬只要小心栽培，很快就能生长起来，这就能够调剂他们好久以来一直借以生存的食品。木材和煤炭也成车地装来了。每出外一次都随时修整路面，道路在车轮的滚动下，变得平坦光滑起来。
“花岗石宫”的食品室还是不断从养兔场取得肉类，幸亏养兔场在甘油河的对岸，否则它的“居民”就要到高地上来破坏新辟的农场了。岩石间的蛤蜊场里经常有新的食品补充进来，从那里可以得到上好的软体动物。除此以外，不论在格兰特湖还是在慈悲河上钓鱼，都可以得到很大的收获，潘克洛夫已经做了几根钓丝，上面装着铁钩，他们常常钓到美味的鳟鱼，还有一种鱼，银白色的腹部带着金黄色的斑点，也非常好吃。炊事员纳布精通烹调，经常更换菜单。他们所差的只有面包了，前面已经说过，这正是他们迫切需要的。
居民们也经常捕捉常到颚骨角沿岸来的海龟。这一带海滩上丘陵起伏，藏有雪白滚圆的硬壳龟蛋，它和鸟蛋不一样，蛋白是不会凝结的。这些龟蛋在阳光下孵化，每一只海龟每年能产卵二百五十枚左右，因此海滩上的龟蛋很多。
“真是一片蛋田，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我们只要伸手去捡就行了。”
可是他们对这些产品还不满足，因此又去猎捕产品的供应者，结果带回来一打海龟，从营养观点来看，这的确是非常珍贵的。纳布在海龟汤里加了一些香料调味，大家吃得赞不绝口。
还有一件幸运的事情也必须提一提，他们得到了大量的冬季储备物资。一大批的鲑鱼进入了慈悲河，分布在上游好几英里之内。原来这正是雌鱼找地方产卵的季节，它们引着雄鱼成群地游入淡水，激起一阵唧唧的声音。一千来条长达二英尺半的鲑鱼到内河来了，居民们在河里做了一个水闸，把它们大量阻拦住。他们就这样捉住了一百多条，都腌了起来，以备冬天河水结冰不能钓鱼的时候食用。这时候，伶俐的杰普也提升为仆役了。它穿着一件外套，一条白亚麻的短裤，系着一条围裙，它对围裙上的口袋最感到兴趣。这只聪明的猩猩经过纳布巧妙的训练，已经有了很大进步，人们看见他们在谈话，一定会以为这个黑人和猩猩是彼此懂得对方语言的。杰普衷心喜爱纳布，纳布对它也是一样。杰普的日常工作是搬柴和上树，当它没有事情的时候，通常是呆在厨房里，模仿着纳布的一举一动。黑人极其耐心而又非常热心地教他的徒弟，徒弟也聪明异常，在师傅的教导下学会了很多东西。
有一天，杰普把餐巾搭在胳膊上，突然出人意外地到桌边来伺候大家吃饭了。“花岗石宫”的主人们是多么高兴啊！它动作迅速，专心致志，完全尽到了自己的责任；换盆子、拿碟子、倒水，一切都做得非常沉着，人人都放声大笑起来，潘克洛夫更是笑得不能自持。
“杰普，拿汤来！”
“杰普，给我点儿刺鼠肉！”
“杰普，拿一个盆子来！”
“杰普，好杰普！忠实的杰普！”
只听见大家嚷成一片，但是杰普还是有条不紊地一一办到，注意着每件事情；当潘克洛夫重新提起第一天的笑话来的时候，它摇头摆尾，好象通人性似的。
“真的，杰普，你的待遇要提高了。”
不用说，现在猩猩在“花岗石宫”里已经完全养驯了，它常跟随着主人到森林里去，从来也没想过离开他们。最有趣的是，它象扛枪似的扛着潘克洛夫给它的棍子走路。假如人们想摘树顶上的果子，它马上就爬上树去。假如车轮子陷在泥里，它也只要肩膀一扛，不费吹灰之力就解决了。
“这家伙真有意思！”潘克洛夫常这样说。“假如它光会顽皮而不好好干活，那就没有办法了！”
一月底，他们开始在荒岛的中部劳动。他们决定在红河发源地附近，富兰克林山的山脚下设一个畜栏，用来豢养反刍动物——因为把它们放在“花岗石宫”附近会发生一些麻烦——特别是他们为了取毛做冬衣的那些摩弗仑羊。
每天早上，小队里的人——有时候是全体，可是多半是史密斯、赫伯特和潘克洛夫三个人——总要经过新辟的畜栏路前往红河的发源地，这一段路不到五英里。
他们在富兰克林山的南面选择了一处地方。这是一块草地，当中有几棵树，一条小溪从山坡上流下来把这块地方的一边围住。这里有新鲜的野草，而且周围的大树并没有把这块地方遮盖起来。他们打算做一道相当高的栅栏围住草地，使最矫捷的兽类也跳不进去。这个畜栏要能够容得下一百只摩弗仑羊和野山羊以及未来的羊羔。
工程师画出了畜栏的边界后，他们下一步的工作就该去采伐装栅栏所必要的木料了，在筑路的时候，他们已经砍倒了不少树木，这时候就拿来做成一百个木桩，牢牢地埋在地里。
栅栏的迎面留了一个相当大的出口，有两扇结实的大门可以关闭。
建立这个畜栏费了不下三个星期的工夫，因为除了栅栏以外，赛勒斯•史密斯还做了些很大的兽棚供动物居住。这些兽棚也必须做得非常牢固，因为摩弗仑羊力量很大，它们乍一来的时候，那股兽性是相当可怕的。因此就把木桩的上端都削尖了，而且把它烤得很硬，用横木钉在一起，每隔一段距离有一根支柱，这样就保证了整个栅栏的结实耐久。
畜栏完工了，该在反刍动物经常出没的草地上打围了。他们选定了2月7日，这是一个明朗的夏天，小队全体都出动了。这时候两匹野驴已经完全训练好了，史佩莱和赫伯特骑着它们。在这次打猎中，它们的用处很大。
他们的计划很简单，就是包围摩弗仑羊和山羊，然后逐渐把包围圈缩小。赛勒斯•史密斯、潘克洛夫、纳布和杰普在森林里各守一方，两位骑士和托普则在畜栏周围半英里之内来回奔驰。
荒岛的这一带摩弗仑羊很多。这种优良的动物和鹿差不多大；它们的角比山羊角还要硬，灰色的底绒上，夹杂着许多长毛。
这一天打猎非常辛苦。他们来回奔跑，有时候骑坐，有时候叫喊！他们围住一百只摩弗仑羊，但是逃走的却占三分之二，最后终于有三十只摩弗仑羊和十只野山羊逐渐被逼近畜栏，畜栏的大门敞开，好象是一条逃生之路，但是一冲进去，就被擒了。
总之，成绩还不错，他们没有理由抱怨，这些摩弗仑羊多半是母羊，其中有几个快下羊羔了。因此，羊群无疑是会扩大的，不久以后就不仅有羊毛用，而且可以得到大量的皮革了。
当天晚上，这群猎人筋疲力尽地回到“花岗石宫”。虽然大家都很累，可是第二天还是到畜栏里去看了一下。俘虏们曾经试图撞倒栅栏，当然它们没有成功，不久以后，也就安静下来了。
二月份全月没有发生什么重要的事情。他们照例进行日常工作，在改进畜栏与气球港之间道路的同时，又开始修筑了第三条道路——从畜栏通往西海滨。在林肯岛上，他们至今还没有探索过盘蛇半岛的森林，那里隐藏着许多野兽，吉丁•史佩莱恨不得一下子就把它们从小队的领土上驱逐出去。
在天气变冷以前，他们特别小心地培育着从森林里移植到眺望岗来的植物。赫伯特每次出游都带回一些有用的菜蔬来。有时候他带来几棵菊苣科的标本（它的种籽可以压榨出一种上好的油料）；有时候带回一些普通的酸模（它是治坏血病的特效药，因此是不可忽视的）；此外，还带回一些珍贵的块茎（它们在南美洲终年生长着）和马铃薯（目前知道的，已经超过两百种了）。现在菜园里出产丰富而且不怕鸟来，许多菜畦分种着莴苣、卵形马铃薯、酸模、芜菁、萝卜和其他十字花科的植物。高地上的土壤特别肥沃，丰收是很有希望的。
他们也有各种各样的饮料，只要不想喝酒，即使最爱挑剔的人也没有什么可抱怨的了。除了薄荷茶和从麒麟树根里提出来的酿造酒以外，史密斯又新添了一种正式的啤酒，这种饮料是用针枞的嫩芽经过发酵和煮沸制成的，味道很好，英美人把它叫做“泉水啤酒”，也就是“松啤酒”。
夏末的时候，家禽场里添了一对美好的鸨，这种鸨属于鸨科，周身的羽毛很特别；还有一打阔嘴鸭，它们的上喙两边都多长了两片长膜；此外有一些美丽的公鸡，它们和莫三鼻给的公鸡有些相象，鸡冠、肉瘤和表皮都是黑色的。到目前为止，一切都很顺利，这应该归功于这些智勇双全的人的积极肯干。当然，他们的自然条件很好，可是，他们信守一句伟大的格言：“人必自助，而后天助之。”
在这炎热的夏天，白天的酷暑过去以后，晚间就吹来了阵阵的海风，这时正好工作完毕，他们总喜欢坐在眺望岗的边缘上，这里是纳布利用爬藤的覆盖而布置成的一个平台。他们在这里谈心，互相提意见，策划着将来，心直口快的水手常给这个小小的世界带来笑料，他们之间永远保持着无比的和睦。
他们常常谈到自己的国家，可爱的美国。南北战争的结果怎么样了？战争不会拖延太久的，里士满一定很快就会落入格兰特将军的手中。一攻破南部联邦的首府，这场可怕的战争就要结束了。现在北军正义的事业已经取得胜利，林肯岛上这群异乡的流浪人是多么渴盼着有一份报纸啊！他们和自己的同胞断绝音信已经有十一个月，再过不久就是3月24日了，这是气球把他们抛到这个无名海滩上来的周年纪念日。从去年那时候起，他们就成了一群难民，甚至在风霜雨雪的侵袭下，也不知道究竟应该怎样保全自己的残生！靠了工程师和大家的智慧，他们现在有了武器、仪器和工具，成了名符其实的移民，他们居然利用了岛上的动物、植物和矿藏——自然界的三大物类。
是的，他们常常谈论这些，而且为未来拟订更多的计划。
赛勒斯•史密斯大部分时间是沉默的，他总是听伙伴们谈话，很少自己发言。当赫伯特天真地谈出幻想和潘克洛夫信口开河的时候，他也许跟着笑一笑，可是他随时随地总在思索着那些不可思议的事实，到目前为止，他还没有猜破那些神秘的谜！
Book 2 Chapter 9
The weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a full moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive. The atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some length of tempestuous weather was to be feared.
Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like volleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately closed, or everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon's egg, Pencroft's first thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger.
He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his crop.
This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled without cessation in the depths of the sky.
The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day. The engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of which was greatly felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder.
Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back, near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter, which perfectly suited his taste.
"With good old Jup there is never any quarreling," often repeated Pencroft, "never any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a servant!"
Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes, he turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered wood, and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted Pencroft--he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed.
As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana, quadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life in the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone, working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness would ever attack them.
All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches in the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he promised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally. Besides he improved himself during the leisure hours which manual occupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after the practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their position, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for languages, masters who were delighted to complete his education.
The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered with clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere, violently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its former purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for three or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About this time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to the same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral, the flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already bleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had each their favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made for the domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was constructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young ones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat under Neb's care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself conscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense of his little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief, and not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a plaything, and his instinct was that of a child. One day in this month of March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the latter had not as yet had time to fulfil.
"You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long ladders at Granite House, captain," said he; "won't you make it some day?"
"Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?"
"Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us think a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but for things it is necessary. It isn't very convenient to climb up a long ladder when one is heavily loaded."
"Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you," replied Cyrus Harding.
"But you have no machine at your disposal."
"We will make one."
"A steam machine?"
"No, a water machine."
And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great difficulty. For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The opening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which escaped by the inner well. Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a basket. In this way, by means of a long rope reaching to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive power, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite House.
It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and gave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal, provisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this simple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be supposed, no one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have possessed Master Jup's skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on Neb's back, or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding attempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln to this new use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did not leave for several days. As to the substances used in the composition of glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or sulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature. Cyrus Harding thus soon had everything ready for setting to work.
The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was the pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which collects on one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of a long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use.
On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand, thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three parts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in crucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube a quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously arranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed the tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.
And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time--that his breath dilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state of fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a bubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube out of Herbert's hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by lengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.
The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was cut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second heating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.
The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this operation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House were soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still sufficiently transparent.
As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with them, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had asked to be allowed to "blow" in his turn, and it was great fun for him; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes, which he admired immensely.
Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest of the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the lad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them heartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other side, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of kangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however, escaped the lad's gun; the consequence was that the day was already advanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy, exclaimed,--
"Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?" and he pointed to a shrub, rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.
"And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?" asked Harding.
"It is a 'cycas revoluta,' of which I have a picture in our dictionary of Natural History!" said Herbert.
"But I can't see any fruit on this shrub!" observed his companion.
"No, captain," replied Herbert; "but its stem contains a flour with which nature has provided us all ready ground."
"It is, then, the bread-tree?"
"Yes, the bread-tree."
"Well, my boy," replied the engineer, "this is a valuable discovery, since our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not mistaken!"
Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was composed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith, traversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance, arranged concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure. This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior quality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by the Japanese laws.
Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far West where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite House, where they made known their discovery.
The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite House with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a press, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten bread, but it was very like it.
Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished daily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of light carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the corral, and when it was Pencroft's turn to go he took Jup, and let him drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary intelligence.
Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and certainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from their native land, had no reason to complain. They were so well suited to this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they could not have left its hospitable soil without regret!
And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of man, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the colonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention, and would have departed!
It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his companions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an October day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.
All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda on the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the darkness creeping up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of elder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb. They were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the Pacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,--
"My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in the case, again taken the position of our island?"
"No," replied the engineer.
"But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument, which is more perfect than that which you before used."
"What is the good?" said Pencroft. "The island is quite comfortable where it is!"
"Well, who knows," returned the reporter, "who knows but that we may be much nearer inhabited land than we think?"
"We shall know to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding, "and if it had not been for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known it already."
"Good!" said Pencroft. "The captain is too good an observer to be mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just where he put it."
"We shall see."
On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the necessary observations to verify the position which he had already obtained, and this was the result of his operation. His first observation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,--
In west longitude: from 1500 to 1550;
In south latitude: from 300 to 350
The second gave exactly:
In longitude: 1500 30'
In south latitude: 340 57'
So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Harding had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed five degrees.
"Now," said Gideon Spilett, "since we possess an atlas as well as a sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln Island occupies in the Pacific."
Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and the engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.
Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,
"But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!"
"An island?" cried Pencroft.
"Tabor Island."
"An important island?"
"No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been visited."
"Well, we will visit it," said Pencroft.
"We?"
"Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?"
"About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast," replied Harding.
"A hundred and fifty miles! And what's that?" returned Pencroft. "In forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!"
And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return of the fine season.
三月的第一个星期，天气有了变化。月初的时候，月亮还很圆，天气也非常热。大气里似乎充满了雷电，可以预感到暴风雨要来临了。
果然，在3月2日那天，传来了隆隆的雷声，大风从东面吹来，冰雹象一阵葡萄弹似的乒乒乓乓地对着“花岗石宫”打过来，他们赶快关上门窗，要不然房里的东西都要搞湿了。这些冰雹大小和鸽蛋差不多，潘克洛夫一看见马上想到：他的麦田要遭殃了。
他立刻向地里奔去，绿色的穗梢已经可以看见了，他用一块大布把庄稼罩了起来。他为了麦穗不遭冰雹打，一点也没抱怨。
这次坏天气继续了一个星期，在这期间，雷声不停地在高空响着。
在两次暴风雨之间，天边不断传来隆隆的雷声。狂风暴雨又袭击了一次，空中闪耀着一道道电光，岛上好几棵树都被雷击倒了。森林边湖畔的那一棵大松树也被击倒在地上。有两三次，雷电打在沙滩上，使沙滩熔化成一种玻璃的晶体物质。工程师发现了这些玻璃物质以后，就想到可以用来在窗上安装又厚又结实的玻璃；这样就再也不用担心风霜雨雪的侵袭了。
他们没有什么迫切需要出去干的工作，因此就乘天气不好，在“花岗石宫”里做了一些事情，现在屋子里的布置一天天完善起来了。工程师制造了一台车床，旋了几件盥洗室和厨房的用品，特别是钮扣，这是他们现在感到非常需要的。又造了一个置放火器用的枪架，他极度小心地保管着它；此外，不论是桌子也好，碗柜也好，都不缺少了。他们锯的锯，刨的刨，锉的锉，旋的旋；在这几日闹天气的时候，只听得工具车床响成一片，和雷声互相呼应。
大家并没有忘记小杰普，他们把它安置在后面仓库附近的一间房里，这个房间象船仓似的，里面有一个吊铺，上面总是铺满着干草，完全合乎它的胃口。
“杰普真好，它从来不顶嘴，”潘克洛夫常常重复这句话，“它也决不强辩！多么好的仆人，纳布，多么好的仆人啊！”
当然，现在杰普服务得很好。它给大家刷衣服、烤肉、侍候吃饭、扫地、捡木柴，还有一件最妙的差事使潘克洛夫特别高兴——它不把可敬的水手侍候到钻进被窝，决不先去睡觉。
至于小队成员的健康，不管是两足动物或两手动物，四手类或四足类都不成问题。户外的生活，卫生的环境，温带的气候，脑力和体力的劳动，在这样条件下他们决不可能想到会生病。
的确，大家都非常健康。经过一年，赫伯特又高了两英寸。他的身体逐渐发育，更象个大人了，他立志要成为一个德才兼备、体魄健壮的全面发展的人才。他做完活，一有空就自修，他阅读箱子里找来的书，他随时随地从日常生活里获得实际知识，此外，他又向工程师学习科学，向通讯记者学习语文，这些老师都是非常愿意把他教育成人的。
工程师要把自己所知道的一切都教给赫伯特，他不但讲给他听，还做给他看。同时，赫伯特也能很好地把工程师教给他的知识用到实际中去。
“要是我死了，”赛勒斯•史密斯这样想，“代替我的就是赫伯特了！”
3月9日，暴风雨过去了，可是在这夏季最后的一个月，天空总是阴云密布。大气经过雷电的激烈震荡以后，还没有恢复它原有的宁静，除了三四个晴朗的日子出猎几次以外，几乎不是下雨就是有雾。这时候，母驴生产了，生下来的一头小母驴长得非常快。畜栏里的摩弗仑羊群也增加了，有几只羊羔已经在兽棚里咩咩地叫起来，纳布和赫伯特听了以后非常高兴，他们在这新添的羊群中，各有自己心爱的羊羔。此外，居民们还尝试了驯化野猪，结果也很成功。
家禽场附近新设了一个猪圈，里面不久就有了几只猪崽，而且性格也逐渐有了变化，也就是说，在纳布的饲养下，愈吃愈胖了。小杰普每天非常热心地送给它们饲料和厨房里的剩菜等等。有时候它喜欢拽那些小猪崽的尾巴玩，可是这仅仅是淘气，自然不能说是残忍，它的天性和孩子一样，把这些弯曲的小尾巴当做玩意儿了。在这三月里有一天，潘克洛夫在和工程师谈话的时候，提醒了赛勒斯•史密斯一件他答应完成但还没有时间完成的任务。
“队长，你曾经说过，可以用一种机械来代替‘花岗石宫’的梯子，”他说，“你能找个时间做起来吗？”
“你说的是一种升降梯吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“随便你说吧！我们就叫它升降梯，”水手回答说，“不管它叫什么名字，只要它能使我们在上下‘花岗石宫’的时候不费力就行了。”
“那再容易也没有了，可是这真有用吗？”
“当然有用，史密斯先生。等到有了这东西以后，想来会舒服多了。当然，对人来说，你可以认为是摆排场，可是对搬运东西说起来，这就是必需的了。带着沉重的东西爬长梯子是多么不方便！”
“好吧，潘克洛夫，我们可以使你满意，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“可是你手头没有机器呀。”
“我们可以做一架。”
“做一架蒸气机？”
“不，做一架水压机。”
的确，工程师已经掌握了现成的自然力量，可以毫不困难地使这种力量为他们的机器服务。要达到这个目的，只要增加供应“花岗石宫”内部用水的水流就行了。他扩大了石子与草丛间的缺口，使甬道的底部产生一股湍急的瀑布，甬道里的水漫出来以后，就从地下井排出去了。工程师在瀑布的下方安装了一个带有螺旋桨的圆筒；外面有一个轮盘，上面缠绕着结实的绳索连接在螺旋桨上，绳索挂着一个吊篮。这样，他们利用一根拖到地面的长绳调节动力，就可以坐在吊篮里，一直上升到“花岗石宫”的门口了。
3月17日开始使用升降梯，结果大家一致满意。从此以后，它代替了原始的梯子，所有的重荷，包括木料、煤炭、食粮，连他们自己在内，都从这个简单的装置里上下了。可以想得出，没有一个人对这项革新不感到满意。托普对它更是着了迷，因为它不能、而且也决不可能具有小杰普那样的登梯技术，它往往不得不攀在纳布的背上，有时候甚至攀在猩猩的背上上“花岗石宫”。也是在这个时候，赛勒斯•史密斯打算制造玻璃，他把那只陈旧的陶土炉子用在这项新的用途上。困难很多，几次试验都毫无结果，但是最后他终于配备好一个玻璃工厂，他的老助手史佩莱和赫伯特一连好几天都没有离开那里。制造玻璃的原料很简单，包括沙粒、白垩和碳酸钠或硫酸钠。海滩上有的是沙粒，石灰里有的是白垩，海藻里有的是小苏打，黄铁矿里有的是硫酸，地里有的是煤，陶土炉子可以加热到必要的温度。赛勒斯•史密斯马上就样样俱全，只等开工了。
最难制造的工具就是吹玻璃的吹管，这是一种五六英尺长的铁管，它的一端用来蘸液体玻璃。潘克洛夫把一条簿薄的铁片卷成枪筒形，也就做成了一根随时可以使用的吹管了。
8月28日，吹管开始使用了。他们在一百分沙粒，三十五分白垩，四十分硫酸钠里掺了两三分煤屑，混和在一起放在坩埚里。当炉里的高温使原料化为液体的时候——说得更恰当一些，是胶状物——赛勒斯•史密斯就用吹管蘸了一些，他在预先准备好的一块金属板上滚了滚吹管，做出一个适合于吹的形状来，然后把吹管递给赫伯特，教他吹另外的一端。
“象吹肥皂泡那样吗？”少年问道。
“是的，完全一样！”工程师说。
赫伯特鼓起嘴巴，往管子里用足气力一吹，同时两手不住旋转着吹管，玻璃就被吹得膨胀起来了。他们在半成品上又涂抹了一层胶状体，不久就制成一个直径达一英尺的玻璃球。然后史密斯把赫伯特手里的吹管拿过来，不断地来回摆动，最后他把这个柔顺的玻璃球拉长了，使它成为一个两头尖的圆柱体。
经过吹的工序以后，再去掉两头的半圆形帽子以后，就形成一个玻璃圆筒。这做起来很容易，只要用锋利的铁片先在冷水里浸湿，就可把两头去掉了，他们又用同样的方法把玻璃筒直着割开，经过再一次加热使玻璃软化了，就铺在平板上用木滚子碾平。
第一块玻璃就这样制成了，他们按照这个方法重复了五十次，就制得了五十块玻璃。“花岗石宫”的窗洞马上变成了玻璃窗；也许还不大洁白，可是却足够透明了。
至于做瓶子和杯子，那更不算一回事了。当这些东西从吹管的末端形成的时候，他们感到非常得意。潘克洛夫请求试试，大家也让他“吹”了一次，这对他真是一种乐趣，由于他吹气太猛，结果吹出来的东西奇形怪状，而他却爱不释手。
在这期间的一次旅行中，他们发现了一种树，它又增加了居民食物的来源。
有一天，赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特出去打猎，来到慈悲河左岸的远西森林里，少年照例提出了无数的问题，工程师都一一恳切地答复了。打猎也和世界上任何的工作一样，不专心地去做，也是不能成功的。工程师既不是猎人，而赫伯特又尽自谈论化学和物理学，于是大批的袋鼠、水豚和刺鼠来到射程之内，都被少年错过了；最后时间已经入暮，这两个猎人几乎就要空手回去了；正在这时候，赫伯特突然站住，高兴得大叫起来：
“啊，史密斯先生，你看见那棵树吗？”他指着一棵树说，这棵树与其说是乔木，不如说是灌木，因为它只是一根树茎包着一层鳞状树皮，上面长着叶脉平行的树叶子。
“这很象棕榈树，究竟是什么树呢？”史密斯问道。
“这是一棵凤尾松，我曾在我们的《博物学大辞典》里看到过一张这样的图画！”赫伯特说。
“可是我看这棵树上没有果实！”他的同伴说。
“不错，史密斯先生，”赫伯特答道；“可是它的树干里却有一种‘面粉’，这是大自然给我们磨好了的。”
“那么，这就是面包树了？”
“是的，面包树。”
“好，孩子，”工程师答道，“我们的小麦还没有成熟，这真是一个可贵的发现；我希望你没弄错！”
赫伯特的确没有错：他折断了一棵凤尾松的枝干，这是由一种腺状的组织构成的，里面有不少粉末，那就是树心，这种粉状的树心夹杂着木质纤维，由年轮——也是粉质的——形成一圈圈的同心圆，把它们分隔开。这种淀粉里混有一种气味刺鼻的粘液，不过，只要一压榨，就很容易把它清除掉。这种细胞质的物质是一种真正的上好面粉，非常富有营养；从前，日本法律还禁止出口哩。
赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特视察了生长凤尾松的这一地带以后，划了一个记号，就回“花岗石宫”去了，他们回去以后，向大家宣布了这个新的发现。
第二天，居民们去收“面粉”了。潘克洛夫对于他的岛愈来愈感兴趣，他向工程师问道：
“赛勒斯先生，你说世界上有没有遇难人的海岛？”
“你这是什么意思，潘克洛夫。”
“好吧！我告诉你，我的意思是说有一些海岛是特地为遇难的人才有的，这些可怜的人在那里总会有办法对付过去！”
“这是可能的。”工程师笑着说。
“这是肯定的，先生，”潘克洛夫说，“至少林肯岛就是这样的一个。”
居民们把大量的凤尾松茎带回“花岗石宫”来。工程师制造了一台压榨机，用来清除淀粉中刺鼻的粘液，经过加工，出产了大量面粉，纳布立刻用它做成糕点。这还不是真正的面包，可是已经很象了。
现在，畜栏里的野驴、山羊和绵羊每天也能供应小队以必要的奶品了。大车已经弃置不用，他们常常驾着一辆单人用的轻便兽力车到畜栏去；每次潘克洛夫去的时候，他总是带着杰普，让它赶车，杰普挥舞起鞭子，照例灵巧地执行自己的任务。
畜栏和“花岗石宫”里一样，一切都欣欣向荣，日渐发展，假如不是因为离乡背井、远隔重洋的话，他们实在没有什么可抱怨的。他们非常习惯于这里的生活，而且也熟悉了这个荒岛，假如一旦要离开这片乐土，他们一定会依依不舍的！
然而，他们热爱祖国的心情丝毫没有动摇，如果有船突然进入荒岛的视线，他们就会发放信号，吸引它的注意，然后乘船离开荒岛。目前，他们虽过着这样幸福的生活，可是他们经常提心吊胆，总希望不会发主任何意外的事情，打断这种生活。
但是，谁敢夸口，说自己能永远保住幸福，免去一切灾难呢？
不管怎么样，居民们在林肯岛上已经住了一年多了，这个岛常常是他们谈话的资料。有一天，他们对岛的位置又作了一次观测，而这次观测却和后来的一切遭遇有着很大的关系。
4月1日是复活节的礼拜天，史密斯和他的伙伴们休息了一天，并且做了祷告。这一天天朗气清，很象北半球十月里的天气。
傍晚，吃完饭以后，大家都坐在眺望岗边缘的平台上，他们凝视着逐渐昏黑的水平线。纳布给大家沏了几杯接骨木种籽的饮料代替咖啡。他们漫谈荒岛以及它孤悬在太平洋中的位置，吉丁•史佩莱不由说道：
“亲爱的赛勒斯，自从箱子里找到六分仪以后，你有没有重新测定过我们这个荒岛的位置？”
“没有。”工程师答道。
“这个仪器比你以前用的那套玩意儿要精确得多了，用它来测定一下也许更好呢？”
“那有什么用？”潘克洛夫说，“荒岛还不是仍旧在它所在的地方吗？”
“对！”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是，不精确的仪器会使测量的结果不准，既然现在可以很容易地得到准确的结果……”
“你说得对，亲爱的史佩莱，”工程师说，“虽然上次可能产生的差错至多不过五度，不过还是应该及早核对一下。”
“那，谁知道呢，”通讯记者回答说，“也许我们离外界比想象中要近得多，谁知道呢？”
“明天我们就知道了，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“假如不是因为事务使我抽不开身的话，我们早就可以知道了。”
“好！”潘克洛夫说。“象史密斯先生这么好的测量家是决不会错的，只要荒岛自己不往别处跑，那么它一定还在上次所记的地方。”
“等着瞧吧。”
第二天，工程师就利用六分仪进行了必要的观测，来证实他已经得到的位置；以下就是他所得出的结果。
第一次观测的结果，他知道了林肯岛的位置：
西经：150度到155度；
南纬：30度到35度。
第二次的数字精确了：
西经：150度30分；
南纬：34度57分。
上次虽然仪器不够完备，然而由于赛勒斯•史密斯量得极度精细，因此他的差错不到五度。
“现在，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“既然我们有六分仪和地图，亲爱的赛勒斯，我们就来瞧瞧林肯岛在太平洋中的正确位置吧。”
赫伯特跑去拿地图，大家都知道，这地图是法国出版的，当然，地图上的地名都是法文的。
他们铺开太平洋的区域图，工程师手里拿着指南针，准备确定他们所在的位置。
突然，指南针在他手中停住了，他大声喊道：
“太平洋的这一带地方早已有一个岛！”
“有一个岛？”潘克洛夫大声问道。
“那一定是我们这个岛。”史佩莱说。
“不对！”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“这个岛在西经153度，南纬37度11分。也就是在林肯岛西面两度半，南面两度的地方。”
“这是什么岛呢？”赫伯特问道。
“达抱岛。”
“是一个重要的岛吗？”
“不，是太平洋里一个荒岛，也许根本没有人到过。”
“那么，我们去。”潘克洛夫说。
“我们？”
“是的，史密斯先生。我们可以造一只有甲板的船，我来掌舵。我们离这个达抱岛有多远？”
“大概在我们这个岛的东北方一百五十海里左右。”史密斯答道。
“一百五十海里！这算得了什么？”潘克洛夫说。“假如顺风的话，四十八个钟头以内就可以看见它了！”
“这有什么用？”通讯记者问。
“现在不知道，以后瞧吧！”
弄清了这个问题以后，大家决定抓紧时间造一只船，准备在将近十月天气转暖的时候启程。
Book 2 Chapter 10
When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it was executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a certain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one.
What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which stands water as well as the elm.
These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would not return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work alone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the domestic duties which had devolved upon them.
Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able to do it. A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the cliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long, furnished with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand.
Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as much about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had at first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably seconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard in Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade. It was not until after careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on the keel.
Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.
A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from his dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in on the 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded the number of grains which had been predicted.
"Five bushels, captain," said Pencroft, alter having scrupulously measured his treasure.
"Five bushels," replied the engineer; "and a hundred and thirty thousand grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains."
"Well, we will sow them all this time," said the sailor, "except a little in reserve."
"Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we shall have four thousand bushels."
"And shall we eat bread?"
"We shall eat bread."
"But we must have a mill.
"We will make one."
The third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the soil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done, Pencroft returned to his work.
During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and they ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their guns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast thicket of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room. The exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in the extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without the pocket-compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way. It naturally happened that game was more rare in those situations where there was hardly sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous animals were however killed during the last fortnight of April. These were koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the north of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be killed among the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge. Their skins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of sulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which rendered them capable of being used.
On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far West, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in a sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had permitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks, round and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small berries. The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned to the lad, to whom he said,--
"What can this be, Herbert?"
"Well, Mr. Spilett," said Herbert, "this is a treasure which will secure you Pencroft's gratitude forever."
"Is it tobacco?"
"Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less tobacco!"
"Oh, good old Pencroft! Won't he be pleased! But we must not let him smoke it all, he must give us our share."
"Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr, Spilett," replied Herbert. "Don't let us say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine day we will present him with a pipe already filled!"
"All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have nothing left to wish for in this world."
The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much precaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of custom- house officers.
Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor suspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long, which was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took two months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.
For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles out in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale of the largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species, called the "Cape Whale."
"What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!" cried the sailor. "Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would say 'After the beast,' for he would be well worth the trouble of catching!"
"Well, Pencroft," observed Harding, "I should much like to watch you handling a harpoon. It would be very interesting."
"I am astonished," said the reporter, "to see a whale in this comparatively high latitude."
"Why so, Mr. Spilett?" replied Herbert. "We are exactly in that part of the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field, and it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales of the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers."
And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of regret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of fishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge how a whaler feels in sight of a whale. And if this had only been for pleasure! But they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize would have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have been put to many uses.
Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the waters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite House, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they were not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left the telescope, but watched all the animal's movements. The cetacean, having entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes, on which it supported itself, and making its way through the water at the rate little short of twelve knots an hour. Sometimes also it approached so near to the island that it could be clearly distinguished. It was the southern whale, which is completely black, the head being more depressed than that of the northern whale.
They could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great height a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear, naturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is it water which is thus driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor, which, condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as rain.
However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It irritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while at work. He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it has been denied. At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly if he had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit state to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.
But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them, and on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the kitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of the island.
Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting, left their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining their companions, all rushed towards the scene of action.
The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles from Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it was best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the Mercy bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach, and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal, above which flocks of birds already hovered.
"What a monster!" cried Neb.
And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty feet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a hundred and fifty thousand pounds!
In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high.
It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.
"There are whalers in these quarters, then?" said Gideon Spilett directly.
"Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn't prove anything!" replied Pencroft. "Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side, and this one might even have been struck in the north of the Atlantic and come to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing."
Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal's side, read this inscription on it:
MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD
"A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!" he cried. "The 'Maria Stella!' A fine whaler, 'pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!--a whaler from the Vineyard!"
And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion, the name which he loved so well--the name of his birthplace.
But as it could not be expected that the "Maria Stella" would come to reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it up before decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched this rich prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it without further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing at them repeatedly.
The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it, which, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass for cow's milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color, nor density.
Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could methodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently disagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers did not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would end by making a "real good castaway."
The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness, then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each, was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did not wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight.
But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six thousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides the fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine, there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless be found, although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at Granite House. The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed, provided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic, of a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which the teeth, six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae, little fish, and molluscs, on which the whale fed.
The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the remains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every vestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of Granite House.
However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived the idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the whale's bones, cut them into six equal parts, and sharpened their ends.
"This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed by the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my friends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them with water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them bent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them with fat. Now, what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these baits? Why, the heat of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone, springing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points."
"Well! I do call that ingenious!" said Pencroft.
"And it will spare the powder and shot," rejoined Cyrus Harding.
"That will be better than traps!" added Neb.
In the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of the month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that her shape was excellent, and that she would sail well.
Pencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could have borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a reward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of the greatest joys of his life.
On that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table, Pencroft felt a hand on his shoulder.
It was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,--
"One moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn't sneak off like that! You've forgotten your dessert."
"Thank you, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "I am going back to my work."
"Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?"
"Nothing more."
"A pipe, then?"
Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he saw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert with a glowing coal.
The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so, seizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal, he drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and from its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,--
"Tobacco! real tobacco!"
"Yes, Pencroft," returned Cyrus Harding, "and very good tobacco too!"
"O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!" cried the sailor. "Nothing more is now wanting to our island."
And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.
"And who made this discovery?" he asked at length. "You, Herbert, no doubt?"
"No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett."
"Mr. Spilett!" exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything like it before.
"Oh Pencroft," said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, "a truce for one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great deal of trouble to keep our secret."
"Well, my friends, I will repay you some day," replied the sailor. "Now we are friends for life."
潘克洛夫只要决定做一件事情，在没有完成之前他是决不撒手的。现在他想到达抱岛去，航海需要一只相当大的船，于是他决心造一艘。
应该用哪一种木料呢？榆树和枞树岛上都很多。他们决定用枞树，因为它砍伐起来容易，而防水的功能并不比榆树差。
决定了细节以后，既然还有半年的时间才到晴朗的季节，因此决定只抽出赛勒斯•史密斯和潘克洛夫两个人造船。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特还是继续打猎，纳布和他的助手小杰普仍然干他们的家务事。
他们马上就选妥了树木，砍下来，去了杈，锯成板，即使是真正的锯木工人恐怕锯得也不过如此。一个星期以后，就在“石窟”和峭壁之间的一块地方，布置起一个造船所；一条长达三十五英尺的龙骨躺在沙地上，它的后部安上了船尾材，前部安上了船首材。
赛勒斯•史密斯进行这项新工作的时候，并不是盲目摸索的。他在造船方面的知识并不比其他方面差，他首先在纸上画好船的图样。此外，还有潘克洛夫做他的有力助手，潘克洛夫在布罗克林的造船所里工作过好几年，很有一些造船的实际经验。他们经过一番精密的计算和仔细的考虑以后，才把肋材架在龙骨上。
潘克洛夫希望实现新计划的焦急心情是可以理解的，他一刻也不愿意离开工作。
有一件事情居然使他离开了造船所，这真是天大的情面，然而也仅仅是一天而已。那就是4月15日那天的第二次麦收。这一次的收成和第一次一样丰收，收获量达到了预期的数字。
“五蒲式耳，史密斯先生。”潘克洛夫认真地量了量他的珍宝，然后说。
“五蒲式耳，”工程师说，“每蒲式耳十三万粒，那么我们一共就有六十五万粒了。”
“好，这次我们把它都种上，”水手说，“只留一点儿。”
“对，潘克洛夫，假如下一次收成也能这样，我们就可以有四千蒲式耳了。”
“那时候我们能吃面包了吗？”
“能吃了。”
“可是我们得有一盘磨子。”
“我们可以做一盘。”
这一次麦田的面积比前两次大多了，他们小心翼翼地把地耕好，然后把宝贵的种籽撤下去。完了以后，潘克洛夫又回去工作了。
在这期间，史佩莱和赫伯特在附近打猎，他们冒险深入到远西森林中尚未到过的地方，他们的枪里装好了子弹，以防万一。这是一片林木幽美的大森林，树与树挤在一起，好象是地方不够似的。在这样的密林里探索是极其困难的，通讯记者每次到这里来都随身带着指南针，因为这里枝叶浓密，几乎连阳光也透不进来，要想循着原路往回走很不容易。一般说来，在这个空间不大的地方，飞禽走兽照例比较少，因为它们没有活动的余地，可是，在四月份的下半月还是打到两三只很大的草食动物。这种动物，居民们在格兰特湖的北岸已经看见过了，那就是“考拉”，它们躲在稠密的树枝间呆呆地束手待毙。“考拉”皮带回了“花岗石宫”，只要用硫酸鞣制一下，就可以使用了。
4月30日，这两个猎人又深入了远西森林；通讯记者走在赫伯特前面，来到一块空地上，这里树叶比较稀疏，阳光一道道透进来。有几株植物，茎干又圆又直，开着一簇簇葡萄似的花团，结有很小的种籽，向四周散发着香气，吉丁•史佩莱闻到以后，觉得有些奇怪。他折断一两根茎枝回来问少年道：
“这是什么，赫伯特？”
“你从哪儿找到的，史佩莱先生？”
“就在那儿，那一块空地上，要多少有多少。”
“啊，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说，“潘克洛夫得到这样宝贝，一辈子也忘不了你的恩德。”
“是烟草吗？”
“是的，虽然不是头等的，但至少算是烟草！”
“啊，好潘克洛夫！他要高兴啦！我们不能让他独享，他也应该留下我们自己的一份！”
“我有一个主意，史佩莱先生，”赫伯特说。“我们暂时不告诉潘克洛夫，我们先把烟叶制好了，等到有那么一天我们再把烟斗装得满满的给他！”
“好，赫伯特，到了那一天，我们的好朋友就会心满意足，什么也不要了。”
通讯记者和少年采集了大量这种宝贵植物，然后回“花岗石宫”，他们偷偷摸摸非常小心地溜进去，好象潘克洛夫是个最机警和最严厉的海关检查员似的。
他们倒没有隐瞒赛勒斯•史密斯和纳布，水手自始至终没有半点怀疑，这一段时间是相当长的，因为必须先把小片的烟叶晒干，再把它们切细，然后放在炙热的石头上焙制。这需要两个月的时间，可是一切都进行得非常顺利，潘克洛夫一点儿也不知道，他忙着造船，只是在睡觉的时候才回家。
在5月1日那天，出现了一个捕鱼的机会，必须全体出动，不管怎样，他却不得不放下自己心爱的工作。
几天以来，他们看见一个庞然大物出没在林肯岛附近两三英里的海面上。这是一只极大的鲸鱼，一看就知道是南方的好望角鲸鱼。
“假如我们能把它逮住，那多好啊！”水手喊道。“要是有一只合适的船和一副上好的鱼叉，我就要下令‘追赶’了，即使麻烦，也是值得一捉的！”
“潘克洛夫，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我很想看看你使用鱼叉。一定很有趣。”
“有趣是有趣，不过是危险的！”工程师说，“现在既然没法逮住它，也就不用操这分心了。”
“我真不明白，”通讯记者说，“这里的纬度相当高了，居然能够看见鲸鱼。”
“怎么，史佩莱先生？”赫伯特答道。“太平洋中英美捕鲸员常说的鲸鱼田就是我们这儿，在新西兰和南美洲中间一带的大洋里，最容易碰到南半球鲸鱼。”
“的确是这样，”潘克洛夫说，“我感到奇怪的是，只看见一条。不过反正我们也近不了它的身，多一些和少一些也是一样。”
潘克洛夫长叹一声，又回去工作了，水手是天生的渔夫，假如钓鱼的乐趣和鱼的大小成正比的话，那么捕鲸员看见一条大鲸鱼的心情是完全可以理解的。要是仅仅是为了乐趣也就算了！可是他们总忘不了这个无价之宝会给小队带来的好处，因为鲸油、鲸肉和骨头用处都很大。
这只鲸鱼现在好象不想离开荒岛的海面似的。于是，赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱在不打猎的时候，纳布在不做饭的时候，总是在“花岗石宫”的窗口或是眺望岗上，拿着望远镜注视着它的一举一动。鲸鱼进入联合湾以后，从颚骨角到爪角，激起了一片急浪，它的身子支持在巨大有力的尾巴上，依靠着尾巴前进，速度每小时将近十二海里。有时候它游到离岸很近的海面来，可以看得非常清楚。这是一只南方的鲸鱼，浑身一片黑，头部比北方鲸鱼稍微扁一些。
他们还看见一股很高的水汽——也许是水——从它的气孔里喷出来；这似乎很奇怪，动物学家和捕鲸员在这一点上意见并不统一。喷出来的究竟是空气还是水呢？一般认为是水汽，在突然遇冷以后，就又化为水滴降落下来了。
这只哺乳动物的出现，简直使居民们朝思暮想、精神恍惚了。特别是潘克洛夫，甚至在工作的时候，他都一直想着它。最后他就象个孩子想要什么东西而得不到似的那样神魂颠倒了。他说梦话也说的这个，假如他有法子去猎捕，而小船又适合入海的话，他一定会毫不犹豫地去追赶的。
可是居民们做不到的事情，一个偶然的机会却成全了他们。5月3日那天，纳布突然在厨房的窗口嚷叫起来，原来鲸鱼在荒岛的海滩上搁浅了。
赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱正打算出去打猎，听见嚷声就放下了他们的枪。潘克洛夫也扔下了斧头，史密斯和纳布跟伙伴们一起冲向那里去了。
鲸鱼在涨潮的时候，在离“花岗石宫”三英里的遗物角搁了浅，因此，不容易脱身了，可是最好还是抓紧时间，必要的时候切断它的归路。他们手拿着鹤嘴锄和搭钩，经过慈悲河桥，跑下慈悲河的右岸，沿着海滨跑去，不到二十分钟，他们就到了这个大家伙附近了；这时候，已经有大群的飞鸟在它的上空盘旋。
“多么大的怪物啊！”纳布喊道。
这声喊叫是非常自然的，因为这只南方鲸长达八十英尺，是一种特大的鲸鱼，它的重量不下十五万斤！
这时候怪物躺在沙滩上一动也不动，虽然还在涨潮，也不挣扎到水里去。
在退潮以后，居民们围绕这个怪物走了一圈。他们立刻明白了鲸鱼不能动弹的原因。
它的左侧插着一根鱼叉，原来它已经死了。
“照这么说，这一带是有捕鲸船的了？”吉丁•史佩莱开口就说。
“为什么呢？”水手问道。
“因为鱼叉还在这里。”
“哎，史佩莱先生，这并不能说明什么问题！”潘克洛夫答道。“听说鲸鱼可以带着鱼叉走上万英里的路程呢，它甚至可能是在大西洋的北部被打中，而跑到太平洋南部这一带来死，这没有什么稀奇。”
“可是……”吉丁•史佩莱说。潘克洛夫的话不能使他满意。
“这是完全可能的。”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们先来看一看鱼叉吧。捕鲸员可能按照一般的习惯，在自己的鱼叉上刻下船的名字。”
潘克洛夫从鲸鱼身上拔下鱼叉，把上面的字念了出来：
“玛丽亚•史泰拉，葡萄园。”
“一只葡萄园的船！我家乡的船！”他喊道。“玛丽亚•史泰拉，这是一只刮刮叫的捕鲸船！没有错，我对它很熟悉！喂，朋友们，一只葡萄园的船！葡萄园的捕鲸船！”
水手挥舞着鱼叉，激动地重复着这个他所心爱的名字——他的家乡的名字。
玛丽亚•史泰拉号自然不会到这里来索取它所投中的鲸鱼的，因此他们决定趁着鲸鱼没有腐烂以前，把它切开。那群飞鸟跟着这个丰富的点心已经有好几天了，它们想立刻占有它，仿佛一时也不能等待了，因此不得不连续开枪把它们驱散。
这是一只母鲸，居民们获得了大量的鲸奶，博物学家德芬巴赫曾认为它可以代替牛奶，的确，不论是味道、色泽，还是浓度，都和牛奶没有什么区别。
潘克洛夫过去曾在一艘捕鲸船上工作过一个时期，他能够有条有理地领导切肉工作。这一项工作相当艰巨，整整进行了三夭，可是居民们并没有被工作吓住，连吉丁•史佩莱也是如此，正如水手所说的，他最后会成为一个“真正的遇难英雄”的。
他们首先把鲸油切成厚约二英尺半的方块，然后再分成许多片，每片重约一千斤。他们就在当地用陶土罐熬鲸油，免得在“花岗石宫”搞得腥气冲天。在熬油的过程中，鲸油的重量几乎减少了三分之一。
可是鲸油很多，仅仅从舌头上就得到六千斤，下嘴唇上又得到四千斤。有了它的脂肪，就可以在相当长的时期中保证供应硬脂和甘油，此外还有骨头，虽然在“花岗石宫”里不用雨伞和支架，但无疑还是有用的。鲸鱼嘴的上部两边有八百块骨片，弹性很大，是一种纤维组织，边上象巨大的梳子，梳齿长达六英尺，鲸鱼可以用它一口衔住上万的小动物——小鱼和软体动物——来营养自己。
工作完毕了，人人都感到非常满意，他们把剩下来的残骸留在海滩上，飞鸟马上就把它吃得一干二净。这事过后，“花岗石宫”的居民又恢复了他们的日常工作。
在回造船所以前，赛勒斯•史密斯忽然想制造一些玩意儿，他的伙伴们都感到莫大的兴趣。他选了十二块鲸鱼的骨头，把它们切成大小一样的六份，并把顶头都削尖了。
“这个东西，史密斯先生，”赫怕特问道，“做好以后有什么用？”
“可以弄死狼和狐狸，甚至可以弄死豹那样的动物。”工程师回答说。
“是现在吗？”
“不，要到今年冬天，当我们手边有冰块的时候。”
“我不明白。”赫伯特说。
“你以后就会明白的，我的孩子！”工程师说。“这种玩意儿不是我自己发明的，俄属美洲阿留申群岛的猎人常常使用它。就是这些骨头，朋友们，等到天寒结冰的时候，把它们用水浸湿了弯过来，让它们完全冻结成冰，由于冻住了，它们就会保持住弯曲形状，然后在上面涂一层油，把它们扔在雪地里。饥饿的野兽吞下一个这样的食饵会怎么样呢？它胃里的热把冰融化了，骨头立刻弹直，骨尖就会把它的身子刺穿了。”
“好，真是天才的发明！”潘克洛夫说。
“这样还可以节省弹药。”赛勒斯•史密斯接着说。
“这比陷阱强多了！”纳布补充道。
“那我们就等冬天吧！”
“好！等冬天！”
在这期间，造船的工程还在进行着，到月底的时候，铺板的工序完成一半了，已经看得出来它的外形非常美观，适合航行。
潘克洛夫以无比的热情，把全副精力投在工作里，只有身强力壮的人才经得起这样的劳累，他的伙伴们偷偷地在给他准备慰劳品，5月31日，他遇到了有生以来最大的一次欢乐。
那天吃完饭，潘克洛夫正打算离开桌子，只觉得有人把手放在他的肩膀上。
原来是吉丁•史佩莱，只听他说：
“等一会儿，潘克洛夫，别偷偷地溜走！你忘了你餐后的消遣品了。”
“谢谢你，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“我要去工作了。”
“好，喝一杯咖啡吧，朋友？”
“什么也不要了。”
“那么抽一袋烟，怎么样？”
潘克洛夫跳了起来，当他看见通讯记者把一只装好的烟斗递给他，赫伯特给他送上一块烧红的火炭来的时候，他那忠厚诚实的面庞发白了。
水手想说话，可是他一个字也说不出来。他把烟斗夺过来衔在嘴里，点上火，然后使劲地抽了五六口，一缕缕芬芳的蓝烟马上升了起来；只听见他在烟雾中一再兴奋地重复道：
“烟！真是烟！”
“是的，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“而且是很好的烟！”
“啊！我的天！万物的主宰！”水手喊道，“现在我们的岛上什么也不缺了。”
于是潘克洛夫抽了一口又一口。
“是谁找到的？”他终于想起来问道。“一定是你，赫伯特？”
“不，潘克洛夫，是史佩莱先生。”
“史佩莱先生！”水手喊道，他抱着通讯记者，紧紧地把他搂在胸前，挤得他喘不出气来，这种滋味真是通讯记者以前从来也没有尝过的。
“喂，潘克洛夫，”史佩莱终于缓过一口气来说。“饶了我吧。你还应该感谢赫伯特，是他认出这种植物来的，还有赛勒斯，是他烤的；还有纳布，他费尽心机保守我们的秘密。”
“好，朋友们，总有一天我要报答你们的，”水手说，“我们的交情要继续到一辈子的。”
Book 2 Chapter 11
Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid clothing.
The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.
Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders, combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt. This felt could then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion. Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted.
The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations, the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning was done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets.
This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times, and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding's engineering qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling-mill.
Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in question, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling.
The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success. The wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on the one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the softening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by the beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly neither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel. It was "Lincolnian felt," and Lincoln Island possessed yet another manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick bedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter of 1866-67.
The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his great regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which he hoped to finish in time for next spring.
The sailor's great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for curiosity's sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this desert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a comparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him some anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be unable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island, what would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters?
Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he himself could give no sufficient reason.
"Now," said the engineer one day to him, "I must observe, my friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it."
"Only to leave it for a few days," replied Pencroft, "only for a few days, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is like!"
"But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island."
"I know that beforehand."
"Then why venture there?"
"To know what is going on in Tabor Island."
"But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there."
"Who knows?"
"And if you are caught in a hurricane?"
"There is no fear of that in the fine season," replied Pencroft. "But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage."
"Pencroft," replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor's shoulder, "if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom chance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves?"
"Captain Harding," replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, "we shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this voyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen our tight- rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together--I fancy, I say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don't conceal from you that your boat will be a masterpiece."
"Say 'our' boat, at least, Pencroft," replied the engineer, disarmed for the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without convincing either the sailor or the engineer.
The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had previously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to it were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should never be allowed to pass without someone going to it.
Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake.
To the engineer's great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.
An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but because it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate with the rest of mankind.
Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps carry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons.
But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island from any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly.
But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without difficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert's gun had slightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten feet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the Pacific.
Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would soon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to him that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to communicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the albatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but that it would return there so soon as it was set free.
Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes came to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized reporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain the article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the Honorable James Bennett!
Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it to forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was fastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then liberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not without some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the misty west.
"Where is he going to?" asked Pencroft.
"Towards New Zealand," replied Herbert.
"A good voyage to you," shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect any great result from this mode of correspondence.
With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House, mending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails for their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case.
During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of either wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking while they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed with profit to all.
It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke, they could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been complete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far from their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with them. They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had left, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could not but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the affairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his views, and his prognostics.
It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say--
"But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement to which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of being sooner or later completely stopped?"
"Stopped! And by what?"
"By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of minerals."
"Yes, the most precious indeed," replied the engineer; "and it would seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond, which is simply pure carbon crystallized."
"You don't mean to say, captain," interrupted Pencroft, "that we burn diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?"
"No, my friend," replied Harding.
"However," resumed Gideon Spilett, "you do not deny that some day the coal will be entirely consumed?"
"Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them."
"With the increasing consumption of coal," replied Gideon Spilett, "it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled."
"Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade."
"For how long a time?" asked the reporter.
"For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years."
"That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our great- grandchildren!" observed Pencroft.
"They will discover something else," said Herbert.
"It is to be hoped so," answered Spilett, "for without coal there would be no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to modern civilization!"
"But what will they find?" asked Pencroft. "Can you guess, captain?"
"Nearly, my friend."
"And what will they burn instead of coal?"
"Water," replied Harding.
"Water!" cried Pencroft, "water as fuel for steamers and engines! water to heat water!"
"Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements," replied Cyrus Harding, "and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by some inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same time. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants, and there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the productions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us. I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the future."
"I should like to see that," observed the sailor.
"You were born too soon, Pencroft," returned Neb, who only took part in the discussion by these words.
However, it was not Neb's speech which interrupted the conversation, but Top's barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which had before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run round the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior passage.
"What can Top be barking in that way for?" asked Pencroft.
"And Jup be growling like that?" added Herbert.
In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation, and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.
"It is evident," said Gideon Spilett, "that this well is in direct communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time to time to breathe at the bottom."
"That's evident," replied the sailor, "and there can be no other explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!" added Pencroft, turning to the dog, "and you, Jup, be off to your room!"
The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained in the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the incident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer.
During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and frost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter, and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although this winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls; the sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of Granite House.
When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.
During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out, owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral. Happily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes, which spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on Prospect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east, suffered considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if it formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved. During the first week of the month of August the weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again became intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero.
On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn Marsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there, and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against these birds.
Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part in this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse, did not join them, but remained at Granite House.
The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to reach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top and Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into execution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone.
Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth of which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the waters of the lake.
Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards other parts of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He had resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during the absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now presented itself.
It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope ladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely fastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent.
The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and there, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well.
The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these points by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either recently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides.
He saw nothing suspicious.
When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water, which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior of the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being could force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth beneath the water, it could not be answered.
Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,--
"I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!"
冬季来临了，这里的六月相当于北半球的十二月，当前的大事就是做又暖和又结实的衣服。
他们已经把畜栏里摩弗仑羊的毛剪下来了，现在需要把这些宝贵的纺织原料织成毛料。
赛勒斯•史密斯既没有刷毛机、梳毛机、磨光机、绷架、绞丝机和纺织机，又没有自动纺车和织布机，因此只好采用一种比较简便的方法来代替纺织工序。他打算利用羊毛纤维的特点——在强大的压力下，这种毛质纤维会粘在一起——用简单的方法制造毛毡。毡的制造过程非常简易，羊毛压缩得愈紧，就愈能保暖。摩弗仑羊的毛很短，用来制毡非常合适。
工程师在伙伴们的协助下，——潘克洛夫只好再度把造船工作搁在一旁——开始了准备工序，这道工序的目的就是清除渗透在羊毛里的脂肪和油质，也就是兽脂。清洁工序是这样操作的：先把羊毛放在盛满水的大桶里，保持着70度的温度，浸了二十四小时以后，再拿出来在小苏打溶液里彻底洗清，等它挤干到一定程度，就可以压榨了，也就是说，可以用来生产出一种结实的毛料了，这种毛料当然是粗糙的，拿到欧美的工业中心去不值一文，可是在林肯岛的市场上，它却非常受人重视。
这种制造毛料的方法，一定在很早以前就有人使用了，事实上，最原始的毛料就是用现在史密斯打算采用的方法制造出来的。在制造压榨羊毛的机器时，史密斯又施展了工程师的本领；他知道应该怎样巧妙地利用海滩上瀑布的机械动力——这种动力直到目前还没有人利用过——来发动一台水力压榨机。
没有比这个更简单的了。把羊毛放在凹槽中间，用沉重的木槌不断交替地捶击，这就是他们要做的机器。几世纪以来，人们一直采用这种机器，直到后来发明了压滚，人们才开始不再捶打，而采用了有规律的压滚方法。
这项工作在赛勒斯•史密斯正确的指示下，获得了完全的胜利，他们事先把羊毛用肥皂水浸过，一方面便于交织、压榨和使羊毛柔软，另一方面又可以免得羊毛在捶击以后会收缩，等羊毛从压榨机里出来之后，就成为厚毡了。羊毛原材料本来很粗糙，由于交织的细密，结果制成的毛料不但适合做衣服，又适合做被毯。当然，这既不是美丽诺呢、细毛呢、开斯米、花毛呢、纺绸、缎子、丝毛呢、驼绒、呢子，也不是法兰绒。这是“林肯毡”，林肯岛上的一种工业品。居民们现在有温暖的衣服和很厚的被子，他们可以毫无顾虑地迎接1866—1867年的冬天了。
6月20日，严寒开始了，潘克洛夫原打算在开春以前完成造船工程，这时候只好暂时停止，他感到非常遗憾。
水手最大的愿望就是到达抱岛去作一次探险，但是史密斯却不赞成纯粹为了好奇而航海，因为在这样一个荒芜不毛的山石上，显然是不可能找到什么东西的。这样一只船——这只船未免稍微嫌小一些——在陌生的海洋上航行一百五十海里，不能不使他有点顾虑。万一他们的船入海以后，到不了达抱岛，而又没法回来。那么在这灾难重重的太平洋中，该怎么办呢？
史密斯和潘克洛夫常谈论这个计划，他发现潘克洛夫对这次航海的要求很迫切，可是他却说不出一个充分的道理来。
“你瞧，朋友，”有一天工程师对他说，“一方面你对林肯岛赞不绝口，时常谈到一旦非离开这儿不可的时候，你会怎样的悲伤，另一方面你又第一个想离开林肯岛。”
“只是想离开这儿几天，”潘克洛夫答道，“只是几天，史密斯先生。去去就回来，看看那个小岛上究竟是个什么样子！”
“可是它还不如林肯岛呢。”
“这我早就知道了。”
“那么干吗冒险上那儿去呢？”
“去了解一下情况。”
“那儿什么也没有，也不可能有什么。”
“那谁敢说！”
“假如你遇到飓风呢？”
“在天气好的季节里，是不用担心这个的，”潘克洛夫说，“可是，史密斯先生，既然我们要防备万一，我要求让赫伯特和我两个人一道去。”
“潘克洛夫，”工程师拍拍水手的肩膀说，“假如你或是赫伯特——别忘了，他只是碰巧才成为我们的孩子的——一旦发生什么不幸，你想我们后悔也来不及啊！”
“史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫的信心还是毫不动摇，“我们不会使你们担忧的。航海的事等将来到了时候再谈吧。我想，等你看见我们的船装备好了，等你看见我们乘着它下海，环绕我们的荒岛——我们要一块儿去——我敢说，你就会毫不犹豫地让我去了。不瞒你说，你的船一定是头等的。”
“还是说‘我们的’船吧，潘克洛夫。”工程师答道，他暂时让步了。谈到这儿告一段落，水手和工程师谁也没有说服谁，都等待以后接着再谈下去。
将近六月底的时候，下了第一场雪。畜栏里预先就准备了大量的饲料，不必每天都去了，他们决定至少每星期派人去一次。
他们又布置了陷阱，史密斯制造的玩意儿也试验过了。他们把鲸鱼骨弄弯后，外面冻上一层冰，然后涂上厚厚的脂肪，放在森林的边缘——野兽到湖边去经常路过的地方。
阿留申群岛渔夫的发明十分灵验，工程师非常高兴。他们得到一打狐狸，几只野猪，甚至还有一只美洲豹；这些动物死在地上，伸直了的鲸骨把它们的胃都刺穿了。
有一件事情必须提一下，不仅因为它本身有趣，而且因为这是他们和外界联系的第一次尝试。
吉丁•史佩莱已经想过很多次了，但是没有肯定，究竟在瓶子里装一封信扔在海里呢——也许海水会把它们冲到一个有人居住的海岸上去的——还是利用鸽子带信呢？
可是他们的海岛和外界相隔一千二百英里，一心指望信鸽或是瓶子远渡重洋，那怎么能成呢！简直是开玩笑。
6月30日，赫伯特一枪打下一只信天翁，它的腿受了些轻伤，大家好不容易把它捉住了。这是一只非常美丽的鸟，两翅展开长达十英尺，它连太平洋也飞得过去。
赫伯特很想把这只艳丽而雄伟的飞鸟留养下来，因为它的伤不重很快就会痊愈，而且他认为可以把它养驯，可是史佩莱向他解释，他们不应该错过机会——利用这个使者和太平洋沿岸地区取得联系。假如这只信天翁是从有人居住的地方来的，那么把它放走以后，它一定会马上回到那里去的。
吉丁•史佩莱不愧为一个新闻记者，也许他很想找一个机会，把他们在林肯岛上的冒险事迹写成惊心动魄的通讯寄到外界去。假如这篇通讯能寄到可敬的编辑约翰•裴尼特那里去，这对于《纽约先驱报》的记者史佩莱本人和刊载这篇通讯的那份报纸来说，是多么大的成功啊！
于是吉丁•史佩莱写了一篇简单的报道放在一个一点不透水的口袋里，袋上写了几句话，恳切拜托捡到的人把它寄给《纽约先驱报》。他们知道这种鸟惯于在海面休息，就把这个小口袋系在信天翁的脖子上而没有系在它的脚上；然后他们就把这个快速的飞行使者放到天空去了，他们眼看着它飞往朦胧的西方，一直到看不见为止，大家心里都很激动。
“它上哪儿去？”潘克洛夫问道。
“向新西兰飞去了。”赫伯特回答说。
“祝你一帆风顺！”水手大声喊道，其实他自己对这种通讯方式并没有抱多大的希望。
随着冬天的到来、他们又开始在“花岗石宫”里工作了，有的缝衣服或是干一些别的事情，有的就利用气囊上多得用不完的材料制造船帆。
七月里天气非常寒冷，可是他们木材、煤炭都不缺少。赛勒斯•史密斯在餐厅里装设了第二个壁炉，他们就在那里消磨冬天漫长的夜晚。他们一面工作一面谈话，闲下来的时候就朗读，在这一段时间里大家都得益不少。
晚饭后，屋子里烛光明亮，人们烤着温暖的炉火，喝着热气腾腾的接骨木咖啡，静听外面狂风怒号，烟斗里散发着芬芳的香气，对居民们来说，这真是一种莫大的享受。假如离乡背井、音信隔绝的人也谈得上乐趣的话，那么他们的乐趣可算是达到极点了。他们常常谈到祖国和久不见面的朋友，以及美利坚合众国的伟大——她的力量会一天天增大起来的；赛勒斯•史密斯很关心国家大事，他谈起很多往事、个人的见解以及对将来的看法，他的伙伴们都听得津津有味。
有一天史佩莱偶然说：
“亲爱的赛勒斯，你预言所有那些工商业都会不断发展，可是它们会不会迟早有一天要发生完全停滞的危机呢？”
“停滞！为什么？”
“因为缺少煤，说句公道话，煤是最宝贵的矿产。”
“是的，煤的确是最宝贵的，”工程师答道，“金刚石其实不过是碳的结晶，大自然所以要产生金刚石，好象就是为了要证明煤的宝贵。”
“史密斯先生，你是说，”潘克洛夫插嘴说，“我们炉子里烧的是样子象煤的金刚石吗？”
“不，朋友。”史密斯答道。
“不管怎么样，”吉丁•史佩莱接着说，“总有一天煤会烧完的，你不能否认吧？”
“唉！煤的矿藏还多得很呢，十万个矿工每年才开采一万万英担，到现在为止要想把煤采完还早呢。”
“随着煤的消耗量一天天增加，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我们可以预料得到，十万个矿工很快就要增加到二十万个矿工，开采量也要加倍了。”
“当然，欧洲的煤矿很快都要使用新机器开采了，可是等欧洲煤矿开采完毕以后，美洲和澳洲的煤矿还可以维持相当长一个时期的工业消耗。”
“可以维持多久呢？”通讯记者问道。
“至少可以维持二百五十年到三百年。”
“我们这一代是可以放心了，可是我们后代的前途可糟糕了！”潘克洛夫说。
“人们会发现别的东西的。”赫伯特说。
“但愿如此，”史佩莱说，“因为没有煤就没有机器，没有机器就没有火车、轮船、工厂以及文明时代不可缺少的一切东西！”
“可是他们能发现什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道，“你猜得到吗，史密斯先生？”
“大致上可以猜得出来，朋友。”
“他们用什么来代替煤呢？”
“水。”史密斯答道。
“水！”潘克洛夫喊道，“用水来做轮船和引擎的燃料，用水来烧水！”
“是的，不过水已分解成它原有的元素了，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“当然是用电来分解的，到那时候水就成为一种强有力而且可以操纵自如的力量了，一切伟大的发现都是根据一种不可思议的规律，彼此吻合，同时逐渐完善起来的。是的，朋友们，我相信总有一天水会变成燃料，组成水的氢和氧也许分开来，也许合起来，它会成为热和光的无尽源泉，它的力量之大，是煤所比不上的。将来轮船的藏煤室和火车的煤水车里装的就不再是煤，而是这两种压缩气体了，这两种气体在炉子里燃烧起来，会产生极大的热能。因此我们不必担心。只要地球存在一天，它就会供给人类一天的需要；只要我们不缺少动物、植物和矿物三界，我们就不会缺少光和热。我相信，等煤用完了以后，我们就要用水来取得热能和温暖了。水就是将来的煤。”
“我希望能够亲眼看得到。”水手说。
“你生得太早了，潘克洛夫。”纳布说，他在讨论中只说了这么一句话。
可是，打断谈话的并不是纳布，而是托普，它忽然又怪声地叫起来，上一次工程师就曾因此感到诧异。内部通道的尽头有一口井，这时候托普边叫边绕着井口奔跑。
“托普为什么那样叫呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“怎么杰普也吼叫起来了？”赫伯特加上一句。
的确，猩猩也和狗一样，表现出明显的不安，说也奇怪，这两个动物愈来愈暴躁和愤怒了。
“很明显，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“这个井是直通大海的，大概常常有海里的动物到井底来呼吸。”
“不错，不会有别的原因了。”潘克洛夫转过身来对狗说，“别叫，托普！还有你，杰普，到你自己的房里去！”
猩猩和狗都安静下来了，杰普回去睡觉，托普还留在房里，当天晚上，它每隔一会儿总要低低地咆哮几声。他们没有进一步谈这个问题，但是工程师却始终为这件事而皱着眉头。
七月的下余几天不是霜就是雨。气温并没有去年冬天低，最冷的时候也只不过华氏8度。这年冬天虽然不太冷，可是风雪却特别多，此外，海潮还常常威胁着“石窟”的安全。海面上常常有滔天的巨浪，好象是被潜流掀起来似的，冲击在“花岗石宫”的石壁上，发出轰然的巨响。
居民们倚在窗口，只见滚滚的海水冲到岩石下面来，被撞得粉碎，愤怒的海潮显然是无能为力，这壮丽的景色不禁使他们大加赞赏。波涛带着耀眼的泡沫奔腾，整个的海滩，消失在狂澜里，峭壁好象浮在浪花高这一百多英尺的海面上。
在这样的风暴里，冒险出去是很困难的，甚至非常危险，因为大树还经常被刮倒，可是居民们还是保证每星期至少到畜栏去一次。幸亏这块圈地有富兰克林山的东南支脉作为屏障，受不到飓风多大的袭击，树木、棚屋和栅栏都保存下来，可是眺望岗上的家禽场却由于正迎着东面刮来的大风，损失就相当大了。鸽棚的屋顶被刮走了两次，栅栏也被吹倒了。这些都需要重新修建，而且应该修得比以前更要结实，因为林肯岛显然在太平洋的一个最危险的区域里。它好象在大旋风的中心，狂风从四面八方不断地侵袭它，就象鞭子不断抽打陀螺似的，只不过是这个陀螺始终保持静止，而鞭子围绕着它转动。八月的第一个星期，天气比较正常，大气也恢复了原先似乎一去不复返的宁静。可是一旦平静以后，天气又严寒起来，寒暑表降到华氏零下8度（相当于摄氏冰点以下22度）。
8月3日，他们到荒岛东南靠近潦凫沼地的地方去打了一次猎，这次打猎，他们已经计划了好几天。猎人们看到一些到这里来过冬的水禽，看得眼红了。这里有无数的野鸭、鹬、小水鸭，大家一致同意过一天专门来打这些鸟。
不仅是吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特，连潘克洛夫和纳布也参加了这次打猎。只有赛勒斯•史密斯推说有工作要做，没有参加，他一个人留在家里。
打猎的人答应在傍晚的时候回来，然后就向气球港出发，直奔潦凫沼地。托普和杰普也和他们一起去了。他们刚刚过了慈悲河，工程师就把吊桥扯起来回家了，他打算单独做一件事。
他要仔细察看井的内部，井口和“花岗石宫”的通道在同一平面上，它一直通往大海，过去它就是格兰特湖的输水道。
为什么托普时常环绕着井口跑来跑去？为什么它要发出那样奇怪的叫声？大概是有什么东西使它不安，把它吸引到井边来的吧？为什么杰普也和托普一样显得急躁不安呢？这口井除了通往大海以外，还有别的支路吗？它能通向荒岛的其他地方吗？这都是赛勒斯•史密斯想要知道的。他一心要趁他的伙伴们不在家的时候探井，现在这个时机到了。
只要有绳梯就很容易下到井底。自从有了升降梯以后，绳梯就放在那里不用了。工程师把梯子拿到井口，井口的直径将近六英尺，他把软梯的上端牢牢系住，另一端一直放到井里。然后他点上一盏灯，拿了一把左轮枪，腰间插了一把弯刀，就开始下井了。
井里空空洞洞，周围有很多突出的尖石，灵活的动物很可以沿着这些突出的尖石爬到洞口来。
工程师注意到这一点，他借着灯光仔细地察看了这些尖石，然而他并没有发现有任何痕迹或是破损的地方可以说明最近或是过去曾被当为阶梯使用过。赛勒斯•史密斯又往下走了几档，他举起灯来，四下探照。
他没有看见任何可疑的东西。
当工程师跨到最后一档的时候，他到达水面了，这时候水面十分平静。不论是水面上还是井内的其他地方，都没有任何孔道可以通向峭壁的内部。史密斯用刀柄在石壁上敲了几下，墙上发出坚实的声音。这是结结实实的花岗石，绝没有一种生物能在里面开出一条路来。海滩的岩石下层土地下，有一条沟道把大海和井底连接起来；要由大海到井底，然后爬到井口来，必须穿过这条沟道，这一点只有水里的动物才能做到。至于这条沟道通到什么地方，在海岸的哪一点，那地方水有多深，谁也回答不出来。
赛勒斯•史密斯察看完毕以后，就上来了，他拉上软梯，盖好井口。他回到餐厅里的时候，还在沉思地自言自语道：
“什么也没有看见，可是那里肯定是有东西的！”
Book 2 Chapter 12
In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of snipe round his body.
"Here, master," cried Neb; "here's something to employ our time! Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must have some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft."
"No, Neb," replied the sailor; "I have the rigging of the vessel to finish and to look after, and you will have to do without me."
"And you, Mr. Herbert?"
"I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb," replied the lad.
"It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?"
"To oblige you, Neb, I will," replied the reporter; "but I warn you that if you disclose your receipts to me, I shall publish them."
"Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett," replied Neb; "whenever you like."
And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb's assistant and was installed in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made known to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day before, and on this point the reporter shared Harding's opinion, that although he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!
The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling was filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned manipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.
During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the sailmaker's needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the sails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks to the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon, the ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the sailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached strong bolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the halyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under Pencroft's directions by means of the turning lathe. It therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their glorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the thirty-seven stars, representing the thirty- seven States of the Union, which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the star of "the State of Lincoln," for he considered his island as already united to the great republic. "And," said he, "it is so already in heart, if not in deed!"
In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.
The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced with complete destruction.
After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four o'clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top's barking.
The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at the threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to burst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.
"Hello, Top!" cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever.
"What's the matter now?" asked Harding.
And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.
Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular yelping noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had been invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen.
"What are they?" cried Pencroft.
"Wolves, jaguars, or apes?" replied Neb.
"They have nearly reached the plateau," said the reporter.
"And our poultry-yard," exclaimed Herbert, "and our garden!"
"Where can they have crossed?" asked Pencroft.
"They must have crossed the bridge on the shore," replied the engineer, "which one of us must have forgotten to close."
"True," said Spilett, "I remember having left it open."
"A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett," cried the sailor.
"What is done cannot be undone," replied Cyrus Harding. "We must consult what it will now be best to do."
Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and fought with if necessary.
"But what are these beasts?" was asked a second time, as the yelpings were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert start, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit to the sources of the Red Creek.
"They are colpeo foxes!" he exclaimed.
"Forward!" shouted the sailor.
And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.
Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves into the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants draw back.
The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite.
This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding's orders, they reached the spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a club.
The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the revolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot coals.
"They must not pass!" shouted Pencroft.
"They shall not pass!" returned the engineer.
But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it. Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already lay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish, and it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually arriving over the bridge.
The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had, with a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had sprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded his weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep him in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time--a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great rejoicing.
At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was coping with great coolness.
However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side of the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of their assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on the shore.
"And Jup!" cried Pencroft; "where is Jup?" Jup had disappeared. His friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his friend's call.
Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found among the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal.
Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest was covered with severe wounds.
"He is living," cried Neb, who was bending over him.
"And we will save him," replied the sailor. "We will nurse him as if he was one of ourselves."
It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft's shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance. it was therefore only the orang whose condition was serious.
Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a slight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to Granite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not appear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been dressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, "just like a real person," as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of a cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless, but his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left sleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one might say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him. One of Jup's hands hung over the side of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.
They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the forest of the Far West, and there buried deep.
This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a lesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one of their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that no invasion was possible.
However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several days, began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor, pronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmend, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of this fault.
"What would you have?" said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes expostulated with him for spoiling the ape. "Poor Jup has no other pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way!"
Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup arose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not be long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all convalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any excess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil's appetite returning.
"Eat away, my Jup," said he, "and don't spare anything; you have shed your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong again!"
On the 25th of August Neb's voice was heard calling to his companions.
"Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!"
The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb's call, who was then in Jup's room.
"What's the matter?" asked the reporter.
"Look," replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see? Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk at the entrance to Granite House!
"My pipe," cried Pencroft. "He has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup, I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!"
And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar.
But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor's ex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor.
"Perhaps he is really a man," said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. "Should you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?"
"My word, no," replied Neb. "What astonishes me is that he hasn't spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!"
"It would amuse me all the same," resumed the sailor, "if some fine day he said to me, "Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft."
"Yes," replied Neb, "what a pity he was born dumb!"
With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again eagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was already completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold.
As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.
Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them, approved the sailor's idea of making the craft as strong as possible. The interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the 15th of September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed, which was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered with boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines in the forest.
The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first been ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime, twelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.
A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into two cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers. The foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.
Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He chose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to square at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast, the rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the Chimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all furnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.
During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected. The corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far West forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were discovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite House.
They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.
On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant with joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely rigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water's edge, was floated by the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of Pencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance was to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having built her, he was to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon him with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the "Bonadventure." As soon as the "Bonadventure" had been lifted by the rising tide, it was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated. However, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion off the coast. The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest.
"All hands on board," shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first necessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the event of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.
Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which had originated with him, although on the sailor's advice he had altered some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft's confidence in her, and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island, Harding hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance in letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a boat, which was not of more than fifteen tons' burden.
At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the Mercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the masthead, and the "Bonadventure," steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.
The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels, according to Pencroft's mode of speaking. After having doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were enchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to be charming.
Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow.
"How beautiful it is!" cried Herbert.
"Yes, our island is beautiful and good," replied Pencroft. "I love it as I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?"
"Nothing," replied Neb; "nothing, captain."
And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their island!
During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched the panorama which was developed before his eyes.
Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.
"Well, Captain Harding," asked Pencroft, "what do you think of our vessel?"
"She appears to behave well," replied the engineer.
"Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?"
"What voyage, Pencroft?"
"One to Tabor Island, for instance."
"My friend," replied Harding, "I think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the 'Bonadventure' even for a longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island with great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there."
"One likes to know one's neighbors," returned the sailor, who was obstinate in his idea. "Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one! Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit."
"By Jove," said Spilett, "our friend Pencroft has become very particular about the proprieties all at once!"
"I am not particular about anything at all," retorted the sailor, who was rather vexed by the engineer's opposition, but who did not wish to cause him anxiety.
"Consider, Pencroft," resumed Harding, "you cannot go alone to Tabor Island."
"One companion will be enough for me."
"Even so," replied the engineer, "you will risk depriving the colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five."
"Out of six," answered Pencroft; "you forget Jup."
"Out of seven," added Neb; "Top is quite worth another."
"There is no risk at all in it, captain," replied Pencroft.
"That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves uselessly."
The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite determined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident would come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was at first only a doubtful whim.
After standing off the shore the "Bonadventure" again approached it in the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the channels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down since this little creek was to be the harbor.
They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary to tack to beat against the wind. The "Bonadventure" was then going at a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land, scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then by passing gusts.
Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,--
"Luff, Pencroft, luff!"
"What's the matter," replied the sailor; "a rock?"
"No--wait," said Herbert; "I don't quite see. Luff again--right--now."
So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the water, and pulled it out, exclaiming,--
"A bottle!"
He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few cables' length from the shore.
Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew the cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these words:--
"Castaway . . . . Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11' S. lat."
傍晚的时候，打猎的人们兴高采烈地满载而归了。的确，他们四个人所拿的东西，多到不能再多了。一串小水鸭象项圈似的挂在托普的脖子上，杰普身上绕满了成串的鹬鸟。
“主人，”纳布喊道，“现在我们有事情来消磨时间了！把这些东西做成肉饼存起来，我们就不愁没有余粮啦！可是得有人做我的帮手。我想找你，潘克洛夫。”
“不成，纳布，”水手答道；“我还要继续做船上的索具呢，我不能帮你。”
“你呢，赫伯特先生？”
“明天我要到畜栏去，纳布。”少年答道。
“那只有你了，史佩莱先生，你愿意帮助我吗？”
“我愿意帮助你，纳布，”通讯记者答道；“可是我要警告你，假如你的烹任秘诀被我知道，我就要公开发表了。”
“欢迎，什么时候发表都成，”纳布答道，“什么时候发表都成。”
第二天，吉丁•史佩莱就成了纳布的助手，在他的厨房里实习。工程师已经把头一天自己探索的经过告诉史佩莱了，在这一点上通讯记者同意史密斯的看法，虽然没有找到什么，然而秘密还是应该继续探索的！
又下了一个星期的霜，居民们除了去照料家禽场以外，始终没有离“花岗石宫”。住所里充满了引人垂涎的香味，这是在纳布和通讯记者大显身手的时候发出来的；可是他们并没有把猎获的全部野味都做成储藏食品；野味在严寒中可以保存得十分完好，因此就把野鸭和其他野禽不加腌制，留着鲜吃，他们认为世界上再也没有比这更鲜美的水鸟了。
在这一个星期中，潘克洛夫在缝帆能手赫伯特的大力帮助下。船帆居然完工了。索具也不缺乏。由于找回了气囊和绳网，他们从网子上得到上好的绳索，水手把它们全都利用了。除了在船帆上附加了结实的棉绳外，还余下很多绳子，都作了升降索、护桅索、帆脚索等等。至于船上用的滑车，赛勒斯•史密斯按照潘克洛夫的主意用车床做了一些。因此在船造好以前，整套的索具就都已完工了。潘克洛夫还做了一面美国国旗，国旗上的蓝、红、白三种颜色是从某些染料植物中得来的，这种植物荒岛上极多。不过，在美国国旗上代表合众国三十七州的光辉灿烂的三十六颗星以外、水手又加上了第三十八颗，代表“林肯州”，因为他认为他的岛已经归入伟大合众国的版图了。他说，“就算事实上还没有归并，心里已经归并了！”
这期间，他们把国旗升在“花岗石宫”中央的窗户上，居民们向它欢呼了三声，表示敬意。
这时候，寒冷的季节即将告终，他们的第二个冬天似乎可以平安地度过了，但是在8月11日的夜间，眺望岗的高地几乎遭到了完全的破坏。
忙了一天以后，居民们都睡得很熟，在第二天清晨四点钟的时候，托普的叫声突然把他们惊醒了。
这一次狗不是在井边叫，而是在门口叫，它用前爪挠门，好象想把门打开似的。杰普也尖声地叫喊着。
“喂，托普！”纳布喊道，他是第一个惊醒的。可是狗叫得更凶了。
“这是怎么回事？”史密斯问道。
大家都急忙穿上衣服，冲到窗口，把窗子打开。
下面是一片冰雪，朦胧中只见一片灰色。他们什么也看不见，可是他们只听到在远处的黑暗中传来一种奇怪的叫声。显然有一群还没有看到的动物侵袭到海边来了。
“那是些什么？”潘克洛夫喊道。
“也许是狼，也许是美洲豹，也许是猴子。”纳布答道。
“糟糕！它们快到高地了！”通讯记者说。
“我们的家禽场，”赫伯特大声叫道，“还有我们的菜园！”
“它们从哪儿过来的呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“一定是谁忘了把桥扯起来，”工程师答道，“它们从桥上过来的。”
“不错，”史佩莱说，“我忘记把桥扯起来了。”
“你干的好事，史佩莱先生！”水手喊道。
“已经过去的事没法挽回了，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“我们最好商量商量现在该怎么办。”
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们匆忙地互相说着话。野兽肯定已跨过桥，侵袭岸边了。不论它们是些什么东西，都能够登上慈悲河的左岸，到眺望岗上来。因此必须赶快迎上去阻止它们，必要的时候，还要和它们拼一场。
“可是这究竟是些什么野兽呢？”当他们听见野兽叫得更响的时候，这个问题又提出来了。赫伯特听了以后吃了一惊，他记得第二次到红河发源地去的时候，曾经听见过这种声音。
“是狐狸！”他叫道。
“快去！”水手大声喊道。
大家分别拿起斧头、马枪和左轮枪、跳进升降梯、很快就到岸边了。
这一大群饥饿的狐狸是非常可怕的动物，尽管如此，他们毫不犹豫地冲上前去射出了第一排子弹，黑暗中发出几点亮光，就把对方吓退了。
主要的问题是要拦住这群强盗，不让它们往高地上去，要不然菜园和家禽场就都要遭到它们无情的蹂躏，难免会造成极大的损失，尤其对麦田来说，可能是无法弥补的损失；可是它们只有通过慈悲河的左岸才能侵入高地；如果把守住这条河与花岗石峭壁之间狭窄的堤岸，就可以抵挡住它们了。
大家都很明白这一点，在赛勒斯•史密斯的指挥下，他们都到达了指定的地点。这时候狐狸在朦胧中凶猛地乱窜。史密斯，史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布形成一道攻不破的防线。托普张开血盆大口，站在人们的前面，杰普挥动一根有节疤的大棍子，象拿着棍棒舞蹈似的，跟在托普的后面。
天色还很昏暗，只有当他们开枪的时候，才能借着左轮枪的火光看见对方，它们至少有一百只，眼睛通红，象燃烧着的火炭。
“不能让它们过来！”潘克洛夫厉声喊道。
“它们过不来的。”工程师应道。
它们没有过来，并不是它们不想过来——事实上后面的狐狸正在向前涌，而是居民们不断用左轮枪和斧头进行格斗不让它们过来。已经有几只狐狸被打死在地上了，可是它们的数目好象并没有减少，也许它们的后援正在源源不断地向桥上涌过来。
移民们不久就只好和狐狸肉搏了，他们受了几处伤，幸而伤势很轻。一只狐狸象山猫似的扑在纳布的背上，赫伯特一枪把它打死，这才把纳布救下来。托普愤怒地搏斗着，它冲过去咬住狐狸的脖子，一会儿就咬死一个。杰普勇猛地挥舞着武器，他们要想叫它留在后面也办不到。显然，因为它生来目光特别敏锐，在黑暗中也能够看见东西，因此它总是到战斗最激烈的地方去；它还不时发出一种尖叫声，表示极大的兴奋。
有一次它跑出去很远，在射击时火光一闪，才看见它正在五六只大狐狸的包围中沉着应战。
搏斗终于结束了，居民们经过整整两个钟头的激战，才获得胜利！天刚破晓，他们就看见对方越过桥头，向北窜去，纳布立刻跑过去把桥扯起来。等到晨曦照亮战场的时候，居民们发现沿岸一带的死狐狸足有五十多只。
“杰普呢！”潘克洛夫喊道，“杰普上哪儿去了？”杰普失踪了。它的朋友纳布大声喊它，它还是第一次不回答朋友的呼唤。
大家都去找杰普，人人提心吊胆，怕在尸堆里发现它；他们把染红积雪的尸体扫在一边，最后在一堆死狐狸中间找到了杰普，这些死狐狸的肢体都已残缺不全，大概都是这个勇猛无敌的畜生拼命用棍子殴打的结果。
可怜的杰普手里还握着半截棍子，它在没有了武器以后，寡不敌众，胸前受了几处重伤。
“它还活着呢。”纳布在它身旁弯下腰去喊道。
“我们要把它救活，”水手说。“我们要把它当作自己人一样好好地看护它。”
杰普好象听得懂似的，它把脑袋倚在潘克洛夫的肩膀上，仿佛在向他致谢。水手自己也受伤了，但是他的伤势也和伙伴们一样，非常轻微；由于他们有精良的火器，对方几乎始终无法逼近。因此，只有猩猩的情况比较严重。
纳布和潘克洛夫把杰普放在升降梯里，它只是有时低低地呻吟着。大家慢慢地把它升到“花岗石宫”上去，然后从床上拿了一个垫子，让它躺在垫子上面，把它周身的伤痕都十分小心地洗干净了。看来杰普并没有受到致命伤，只不过由于流血过多，因此非常虚弱，创口包好以后不久，它就发起高烧来了。杰普躺了下来，饮食按严格规定供给，正如纳布所说的，“完全要象一个真人那样。”他们给它喝了几杯清凉的饮料，这是从“花岗石宫”的药草箱里取出的药泡成的。杰普最初很不安静，可是呼吸逐渐就正常起来了，大家让它安安稳稳地熟睡着。托普也常常蹑手蹑脚地——人们不妨这样说——来探望它的朋友，它对于大家的看护似乎表示很满意。杰普的一只手露在床铺外边，托普非常关怀地舔着它的手。
他们趁着白天把死狐狸运到远西森林里去，将它们全埋起来了。
这一次袭击险些儿造成惨痛的后果；对居民们说来是一次教训；从此以后，他们一定要问明白吊桥确实都已扯起来，决不可能受到侵犯以后，才敢上床睡觉。
焦急地等待了好几天，杰普终于逐渐好转了。由于它身体结实，才脱离了险境，热度逐渐减退，吉丁•史佩莱稍微懂得一些医道，这时候他告诉大家，它已经没有生命危险了。8月16日，杰普的饮食恢复正常了。纳布给它做了几份美味的菜肴，病“人”吃得津津有味；如果说杰普有什么毛病的话，那就是它稍微有些贪吃，这个缺点，纳布始终没有给它纠正过来。
“你说该怎么办呢？”纳布对吉丁•史佩莱说，因为史佩莱常常劝他不要把猩猩宠坏了。“除了吃以外，可怜的杰普就没有别的乐趣了，我非常愿意在这方面为它效劳！”
躺了十天以后，到8月21日，小杰普起床了。它的伤势已经痊愈，肯定地说，再过不久，就可以恢复原有的体力和灵活。和所有大病初愈的人一样，它的胃口特别好，通讯记者让它尽量多吃，他相信猩猩有节制自己的本能，这种本能人类往往是没有的。纳布看见他的徒弟恢复了饭量，感到非常高兴。
“尽量吃吧，我的杰普，”他说，“什么也不用留；你为我们流了血，我无论如何也要想法子让你恢复健康！”
8月25日，大家忽然听见纳布在喊他们。
“史密斯先生、史佩莱先生、赫伯特先生、潘克洛夫，来啊！来啊！”
当时纳布正在杰普的房里，居民们听见他叫喊，就从餐厅里跑去。
“怎么回事？”通讯记者问道。
“瞧啊。”纳布笑着说。他们看见了什么呢？原来小杰普在“花岗石宫”的过道里，象一个顽皮的孩子似的，叉着两腿，一本正经地坐在那里静静地抽着烟！
“我的烟斗，”潘克洛夫喊道，“它把我的烟斗拿去了！喂，我的好杰普，我把它送给你吧！抽吧，老兄，抽吧！”
杰普规规矩矩地喷着烟，好象感到非常满意。史密斯对这件事倒不觉得奇怪，他举了许多事实，说明养驯的人猿是能够养成吸烟的习惯的。
从这天起，小杰普就自备了一只烟斗，这是水手原有的烟斗，一向吊在他房里靠烟草的地方。杰普自己装烟，自己用火炭点烟，在猿猴之中，恐怕再也找不到比它更逍遥自在的了。忠实的杰普和善良的水手，原先就已结下了深厚的友谊，现在又有了共同的嗜好，不难理解，他们的友谊更进一步地加深了。
“也许它真的是一个人，”潘克洛夫常常对纳布说。“要是有一天，它开口和我们说话，你会感到奇怪吗？”
“不，决不会，”纳布答道。“相反地它一直没有和我们说过话，倒使我感到奇怪，现在它只差会说话了！”
“如果有一天它对我说，‘潘克洛夫，我们换个烟斗吧，’”水手接着说，“我还是会觉得有趣的。”
“是啊，”纳布说，“真可惜，它生来是个哑巴！”
九月初，残冬已尽，大家又开始忙着工作了。造船的工程进行得非常迅速，甲板已经完全铺好，船身的内部都用蒸气熏弯了的肋材——它的形状完全适合船的轮廓——牢固地连接起来。
木料非常富裕，潘克洛夫向工程师提议做一个双层的内壁，这样，船身就更牢固一些。
史密斯也没法估计将来会遇到什么情况，因此同意水手的意见，把船造得愈结实愈好。9月15日，船的内部和甲板完全竣工了。为了堵塞漏缝，他们把海藻晒干，作为填絮，用锤子把它们凿到木板的夹缝里去，又从松林里找来大量的松脂，熔化以后，涂在上面。
这只船驾驶起来非常简单。他们首先用石灰把沉重的花岗石块砌成压仓的底货，这些东西共重一万二千斤。
压仓的石块上铺了一层甲板，船的内部分成两间仓房；仓里有两条坐板，也可以当作橱柜。桅杆的底部支持着两仓之间的隔板，通过两个仓口就可以从甲板上到船仓里去。
潘克洛夫没费多大气力，就找到一棵适合做桅杆的树。这是一棵没有节的小枞树，只要把桅座砍成方形，顶部刨圆就行了。桅杆、舵和船身用的铁活都是在“石窟”里做好的，虽然粗糙一些，却很结实。在十月的第一周，终于连帆架、桅柱、帆杠、圆材、桨等等全做好了，大家一致同意作一次环岛的试航，好熟悉一下船的航行性能和可以利用的程度。
在这期间，一切必要的工作都照常进行着。摩弗仑羊和山羊新添了许多羊羔，必须让它们有吃有住，因此把畜栏扩大了。移民们也到过其他的地方，象蛤蜊场、养兔场、煤矿区和铁矿区，以及一直没有探索过的远西森林地带，那里有大量的飞禽走兽。他们发现了一些土生的植物，这些植物虽然不是那么迫切需要，却增加了“花岗石宫”疏菜储藏室里的品种。
这是一些番杏科植物，其中有的和好望角产的相似，长有肉厚的叶子，可以吃；有的种籽里含有淀粉质。
10月10日，新船下水了。造船的工作获得了完全的成功，潘克洛夫喜气洋洋。船上的索具装配完毕，用滚轮把船推到水边以后，潮水一涨，在移民们的欢呼中，船就浮起来了。潘克洛夫叫得特别起劲，他这时候真是得意忘形。再说，船造好以后，他的工作还不算完，因为还需要他来调度指挥。在大家一致推崇的情况下，他光荣地接受了“船长”的称号。为了使潘克洛夫船长满意，现在必须给船起一个名字，经过一再的商讨，最后大家都赞成用“乘风破浪”这个名字。潮水把乘风破浪号一浮起来，大家就看出它在水里非常平稳，很容易驾驶。试航决定就在当天举行，他们要离开海滨，作一次航行。天气很好，海面上风平浪静，特别是南部海滨一带，因为当天刮的是西北风。
“全体上船。”潘克洛夫船长下了命令。他们在动身之前先吃了早饭，大家认为最好把食品带一些上船，因为他们这次航行也许要到傍晚才能回来。
赛勒斯•史密斯同样也急于要试一试这只船，因为，船的图样是他设计的，只是根据水手的意见，作了一些修改。但是他并不象潘克洛夫那样信心十足，水手后来没有再提到达抱岛去的事情，史密斯很希望他就此打消了这个念头。的确，让两三个伙伴乘着这只载重不过十五吨的小船去冒险，工程师是无论如何也不赞成的。
十点半钟，全体——托普和杰普也包括在内——都上了船，赫伯特把深深陷入慈悲河口沙滩的铁锚拔了起来。他们升起船帆，桅顶飘扬起林肯岛的旗号，乘风破浪号由潘克洛夫驾驶着，向海洋出发了。
船顺着从联合湾吹来的风向前行驶，正如潘克洛夫所说的，跑得非常快；它的主人们看了这种情况，都表示很满意。绕过遗物角和爪角以后，船长抢风而行，使船沿着荒岛的南岸前进；这时候可以看出，它的航行情况很好，没有超过风向的五个方位以外。海员们全都非常高兴，他们船的性能很好，必要的时候，准会给他们极大的帮助，只要风和日暖，航海一定顺利。
潘克洛夫现在使船离岸行驶，距气球港有三四英里。这时候他们看清了海岛的全貌，这是一幅新的景象，沿岸一带，从爪角到爬虫角，景色不断地变化着，森林里枞树的深色和其他树木的新绿形成鲜明的对比，一眼看去，满目苍翠，只有富兰克林山的顶峰，还积着皑皑的白雪。
“多美啊！”赫伯特叫道。
“是的，我们的岛又美又好，”潘克洛夫说。“我爱它就和爱我可怜的母亲似的。我们刚来的时候孤苦伶仃，可是现在我们这五个从天上掉下来的人还缺少什么呢？”
“什么也不少，”纳布答道；“船长，什么也不少。”
于是这两位勇士欢呼三声，向海岛表示敬意！
这时候，吉丁•史佩莱一直靠着船桅，描绘着面前展开的活动画面。
赛勒斯•史密斯默默地看着。
“史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫问道，“你觉得我们的船怎么样？”
“好象不错。”工程师答道。
“好！现在你认为它可以航行到比较远的地方去吗？”
“到哪儿去，潘克洛夫？”
“譬如说，到达抱岛去。”
“朋友，”史密斯答道，“如果遇到什么紧急事故，我也不妨坐乘风破浪号到更远的地方去，可是你要知道，我眼看着你到达抱岛去，实在很不放心，既然不是非去不可，那又何必冒险呢。”
“人人都想了解一下邻居的情况，”水手说，他的想法还没有变。“达抱岛是我们的邻居，而且是唯一的邻居！按礼貌也应该去拜访一次。”
“啊唷，”史佩莱说，“我们的朋友潘克洛夫忽然也讲究起礼节来了！”
“我什么也不讲究。”水手反驳道。工程师坚持反对使他很不高兴，然而他又不愿意让工程师替他担心。
“你想，潘克洛夫，”史密斯接着说，“你一个人是不能到达抱岛去的。”
“只要有一个人陪我去就够了。”
“就算这样，”工程师答道，“你这么一来，林肯岛上的五个居民就有减少两个的危险。”
“六个居民，”潘克洛夫说，“你忘记杰普了。”
“七个，”纳布补充道，“托普也配得上一个。”
“一点也不危险。史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫回答说。
“也可能不危险，潘克洛夫；可是我要再说一遍，这样做实际上是一种不必要的冒险。”
固执的水手不回答了，话谈到这里暂时告一段落，但是他决定以后还要接着谈下去。他没有想到，一会儿就要发生一件事情，这件事情成全了他，而且要使最初只不过是一种不一定有意义的愿望一下子变成一桩非做不可的好事。
离岸航行了一会以后，乘风破浪号又向着气球港的海岸驶去。必须查探一下沙洲和礁石之间的侮峡，必要的时候，还得布置浮标，因为小溪将要成为停泊船只的港口。
他们离岸不过半英里，必须迎面斜兜着海风调向前进。由于风被一部分高地挡住了，乘风破浪号的速度非常缓慢，这时候，甚至船上的帆都鼓不起来了，海面平静得和镜子一样，只是偶尔有风吹过，才泛起一片波纹。
赫伯特一直站在船头上指示着在海峡中航行的方向，这时候他忽然大声喊道：“向风行驶，潘克洛夫，向风行驶！”
“怎么回事，”水手问道，“有礁石吗？”
“不……等一会儿，”赫伯特说，“我还看不清楚，再向着风……现在往右。”
赫伯特一面说，一面侧着身子，把一只手伸到水里去，捞出一件东西来，叫道：
“一只瓶子！”
他手里拿着一只塞着软木塞的瓶子，捞这个瓶子的地方离海岸不过几锚链远。
赛勒斯•史密斯把瓶子接过来。他一言不发地拔开瓶塞，从里面拿出一张已经浸湿了的纸来，上面写着：
“遇难人……达抱岛：西经153度，南纬37度11分。”
Book 2 Chapter 13
"A castaway!" exclaimed Pencroft; "left on this Tabor Island not two hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won't now oppose my going."
"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding; "and you shall set out as soon as possible."
"To-morrow?"
"To-morrow!"
The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,
"From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded, we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the latitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or American, as the document is written in the English language."
"That is perfectly logical," answered Spilett; "and the presence of this castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island. There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the latter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of building this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and this bottle might have been broken on the rocks."
"Indeed," said Herbert, "it is a fortunate chance that the 'Bonadventure' passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!"
"Does not this appear strange to you?" asked Harding of Pencroft.
"It appears fortunate, that's all," answered the sailor. "Do you see anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?"
"Perhaps you are right, Pencroft," replied the engineer; "and yet--"
"But," observed Herbert, "there's nothing to prove that this bottle has been floating long in the sea."
"Nothing," replied Gideon Spilett, "and the document appears even to have been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?"
During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put the vessel about, and the "Bonadventure," all sails set, was running rapidly towards Claw Cape.
Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they be in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the colonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared that another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go to his succor.
Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o'clock the "Bonadventure" dropped her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.
That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made. It appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the vessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day, the 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present wind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage of a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to return, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising, the wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island.
Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett should remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage.
The evening was occupied in transporting on board the "Bonadventure," articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions for a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite House.
The next day, at five o'clock in the morning, the farewells were said, not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the southwest.
The "Bonadventure" was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.
"Our friends," exclaimed Spilett, "this is our first separation in fifteen months."
Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.
During the first part of the day the "Bonadventure" was still in sight of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights, diminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten miles.
At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin, and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.
The "Bonadventure" behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad's hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find fault with.
Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with his crew.
In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first quarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The night was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine.
Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent sailor and cannot be blamed for it.
The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns for a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as he would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman, and Herbert never allowed the "Bonadventure" to swerve even a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of October. A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the "Bonadventure" fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly within sight of Tabor Island.
As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely deserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he had confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the ocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.
"And yet," observed Herbert, "this is the time that whalers usually proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think there could be a more deserted sea than this."
"It is not quite so deserted as all that," replied Pencroft.
"What do you mean?" asked the reporter.
"We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?"
And Pencroft laughed at his joke.
By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the "Bonadventure" had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six hours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots an hour. The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether. However, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the calculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor Island.
Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion. There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor Island? Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the little colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to exchange his prison for another? All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon.
"Land!" shouted Pencroft at about six o'clock in the morning.
And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was evident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of the "Bonadventure." In a few hours they would land on the beach of the island!
The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not more than fifteen miles distant.
The head of the "Bonadventure," which was a little to the south of the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east, its rays fell upon one or two headlands.
"This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island," observed Herbert, "and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion."
At eleven o'clock the "Bonadventure" was not more than two miles off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land, proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum and other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln Island. But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!
And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this castaway should have been on the watch.
In the meanwhile the "Bonadventure" entered the winding channels among the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail at a moment's notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving anything.
However, at about twelve o'clock the keel of the "Bonadventure" grated on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of the little vessel landed.
And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since according to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast.
The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of her being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his companions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile.
"From the summit of that hill," said Spilett, "we can no doubt obtain a complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search."
"So as to do here," replied Herbert, "that which Captain Harding did the very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin."
"Exactly so," answered the reporter, "and it is the best plan."
While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing which terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and sea- swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them. Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited.
Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.
They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories, bays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in sight.
This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth.
"The domain is limited," said Herbert.
"Yes," rejoined Pencroft: "It would have been too small for us."
"And moreover," said the reporter, "it appears to be uninhabited."
"Indeed," answered Herbert, "nothing here betrays the presence of man."
"Let us go down," said Pencroft, "and search."
The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place where they had left the "Bonadventure."
They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their investigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed round. The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance.
"Those beasts yonder," observed the reporter, "do not see men for the first time. They fear them, therefore they must know them."
An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background bordered with thick woods.
There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours' walking had been gone completely round.
It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps, after all the document was already several months or several years old, and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.
Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable conjectures, dined rapidly on board the "Bonadventure" so as to be able to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five o'clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood.
Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.
Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had rapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take them back to Lincoln Island.
It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the hand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find them.
"But," observed Gideon Spilett, "this not only proves that men have landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now, who were these men? How many of them remain?"
"The document," said Herbert, "only spoke of one castaway."
"Well, if he is still on the island," replied Pencroft, "it is impossible but that we shall find him."
The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.
If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed incontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the midst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with culinary plants, at probably the same distant period.
What, then, was Herbert's joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory, sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.
"Capital, jolly!" exclaimed Pencroft. "That will suit Neb as well as us. Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have been useless, and God will have rewarded us."
"Doubtless," replied Gideon Spilett, "but to see the state in which we find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been inhabited for some time."
"Indeed," answered Herbert, "an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not have neglected such an important culture!"
"Yes," said Pencroft, "the castaway has gone."
"We must suppose so."
"It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?"
"Evidently."
"And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated in the sea a long time."
"Why not?" returned Pencroft. "But night is coming on," added he, "and I think that it will be best to give up the search for the present."
"Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again," said the reporter.
This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when Herbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,--
"A hut!"
All three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick tarpaulin.
The half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a rapid step.
The hut was empty!
“一个遇难的人流落在达抱岛上了！”潘克洛夫大声说，“离我们几百英里！啊，史密斯先生，现在你不再反对我去了吧。”
“不错，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说；“你尽快地动身吧。”
“明天怎么样？”
“就明天吧！”
工程师手里还拿着瓶子里的那张纸。他仔细地察看了一会，然后接着说：
“朋友们，从这张纸上，从它的措辞上了我们可以得出这样的结论：首先，达抱岛上的遇难人具有相当丰富的航海知识，因为他所写的达抱岛的经纬度和我们测量出来的完全相同，而且他连分度也大致求出来了；其次，他不是英国人就是美国人，因为他写的是英文。”
“完全合乎道理，”史佩莱说，“有了这个遇难人，就可以说明我们在岛上找到的那只箱子是从哪里来的了。既然有遇难的人，就一定有过遇难的船，潘克洛夫想起来要造船，而且偏在今天试航，对于这个遇难的人来说，不管他是谁，总算是他的运气。再晚一天，瓶子也许就会撞在石头上碰得粉碎。”
“的确，”赫伯特说，“乘风破浪号正好从它漂着的地方经过，真是太巧了！”
“你觉得这件事奇怪吗？”史密斯向潘克洛夫问道。
“我只觉得凑巧，”水手回答说：“你觉得有什么奇怪吗，史密斯先生？瓶子总要漂到一个地方去的，既然能漂到别处去，为什么就不能漂到这儿来呢？”
“也许你说得对，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道，“不过……”
“可是，”赫伯特说，“还是没法证明瓶子在海里已经漂浮多久了。”
“不错，”吉丁•史佩菜说；“这张纸条好象还是最近才写的。你认为怎么样，赛勒斯？”
“很难说，我们以后会知道的。”史密斯答道。
谈话的时候，潘克洛夫并没有闲着。他掉转了船的方向，乘风破浪号扯起满帆，飞快地向爪角驶去。
人人都在想达抱岛上的遇难人。他们去救他还来得及吗？在移民们的生活中，这是一件大事！他们自己也是遇难的人，但是恐怕别人遇难就不会有这样幸运了，他们有责任去帮助他。
他们绕过爪角，大约四点钟的时候，乘风破浪号在慈悲河口抛锚了。
当晚他们就积极准备新的远征。看来由潘克洛夫和赫伯特两人前去探险最合适，因为他俩都懂得怎样行船。如果第二天（10月11日）启程，13日他们就可以到达目的地，因为以目前的风势来说，要不了四十八小时就可以航行一百五十海里。在达抱岛上逗留一天，回来需要三四天。因此，预计在10月17日他们就可以回林肯岛了。近来天气晴朗，温度上升，风势好象也很稳定，一切都有利于这两位勇士远离海岛去完成这桩义举。
大家决定，让赛勒斯•史密斯、纳布和吉丁•史佩莱留在“花岗石宫”里，可是史佩莱提出了不同意见，他毕竟没有忘记自己是《纽约先驱报》的通讯记者，他表示即使游泳过去也愿意，决不错过这样的机会，于是他被批准参加远征了。
傍晚的时候，大家忙着把一切需要的东西搬到船上去，其中有铺盖、器皿、武器、弹药、指南针以及够吃一星期的粮食，这些工作很快地做完以后，移民们就回到“花岗石宫”去了。
第二天清晨五点钟，大家互相告别，这时候，彼此都有些依依不舍。潘克洛夫扬起了帆，向爪角出发了，他们必须绕过爪角，向西南前进。
离岸已经四分之一海里了，乘风破浪号上的旅客们还看见在“花岗石宫”的高岗上有两个人在向他们挥手惜别，那就是赛勒斯•史密斯和纳布。
“朋友们，”史佩莱不禁喊道，“十五个月以来，我们还是第一次分别呢。”
潘克洛夫、通讯记者和赫伯特也向他们招手致意，不久以后，“花岗石宫”就消失在爪角的石壁后面了。
这一天上午，乘风破浪号一直在林肯岛以南一带，过了不久，他们再看看海岛，海岛就好象一个绿色的篮子，高耸在海岛中央的是富兰克林山。从远处看来，山岗显得并不突出，它吸引不住过往船只的注意。走了一个钟头的光景，他们已经入海离爬虫角十海里左右了。
现在已经看不清一直伸展到富兰克林山山脊的西海岸；三个钟头以后，整个的林肯岛都消失在水平线下边了。
乘风破浪号航行的情况很好。它穿过波浪，飞快地向前驶去。潘克洛夫张起前帆，按照指南针，掌握着直线方向前进。赫伯特和他轮流掌舵，少年的双手非常牢稳，水手连一点毛病找不出来。
吉丁•史佩莱有时和这个谈谈，有时和那个谈谈，必要的时候，他也帮助料理一下绳索；潘克洛夫船长对他的俩个水手感到十分满意。
傍晚，一钩新月在苍茫的暮色中出现了片刻，不久就落下去了，要等到16日，才能看到上弦月。夜色非常昏暗，然而满天星斗，可以断定明天还是晴天。
潘克洛夫小心地落下前帆，以防在满帆的时候突然遭到夜风的袭击。夜晚这样平静，这样小心也许是多余的，然而潘克洛夫是一个谨慎的水手，这样做并没有错。
通讯记者夜里睡了半宿。潘克洛夫和赫伯特轮流在舵旁休息，两个钟头一换班。水手相信赫伯特简直和相信自己一样，少年的沉着和果断足以证明他的信任是正确的。潘克洛夫象船长指挥舵手似的指示着他，赫伯特一刻也没有使乘风破浪号的前进方位发生偏差。第一夜平安度过了，10月12日白天的情况也是这样。他们严格地保持着向西南方前进，如果乘风破浪号不遇到别的海流，它一定能直接驶入达抱岛的视线范围。
当时在他们一路经过的海面上四望无人，偶尔有只把巨大的信天翁或是军舰鸟飞到枪弹的射程以内来，吉丁•史佩莱不禁想起这是不是他上次用来带信给《纽约先驱报》的那只呢？达抱岛和林肯岛之间的一带洋面，好象只有这种鸟常常往来。
“可是，”赫伯特说，“现在是捕鲸船常到南太平洋来的季节，真的，我想再也找不到比这儿更寂寞的海面了。”
“并不象你所说的那么寂寞。”潘克洛夫说。
“我不明白你的意思。”通讯记者说。
“还有我们在海面上呢，难道你们把这只船当做难船，把自己当做小鲸鱼了吗？”
潘克洛夫一面说，一面笑。
傍晚的时候，他们估计乘风破浪号离开林肯岛以来，也就是说在这三十六小时内，已经航行一百二十海里了；它的每小时速度是三海里到四海里。现在风势很小，而且可能马上就要停下来。尽管这样，如果估计得不错，航线也正确，明天破晓的时候，他们还是能够看见达抱岛的。
在10月12到13日的这一夜，吉丁•史佩菜、赫伯特和潘克洛夫都没有睡觉。由于盼望着天明，他们不免有些激动。这次冒险的前途怎样，很难预料！他们是不是已经要到达抱岛了呢？他们要救的那个遇难人还在岛上吗？这个人究竟是什么人？这几个移民一向团结得很好，他们的团结会不会因为多了这个人而遭到破坏呢？此外，那个遇难人愿不愿换一个困守的地方呢？毫无疑问，所有这些问题，明天都可以得到解决，然而现在却使他们安不下心来。天一亮，他们的眼睛就全都注视着西方的水平线。
“陆地！”潘克洛夫喊道，这时是清晨六点钟。
潘克洛夫是不会看错的，陆地肯定是在那里，我们不难想象乘风破浪号上的水手们这时是多么高兴。再过几个钟头，他们就可以登上达抱岛的海滩了！
达抱岛的海岸很低，只比水面稍微高出一点点，现在离他们不过十五海里了。
乘风破浪号直对着海岛开会，船头稍稍偏向它的南部，太阳从东方升起，阳光照耀着一两处海峡。
“这个小岛比起林肯岛来还要小，”赫伯特说，“大概和我们那个岛一样，也是由海底地震形成的。”
十一点钟的时候，乘风破浪号离海岛不过二海里了；潘克洛夫一面寻找适合登陆的海岸，一面小心翼翼地在陌生的海面上继续前进。现在可以清楚地看到达抱岛了，可以看见岛上丛生着一些橡皮树和其他的大树，它们的品种都和林肯岛上的一样，令人感到诧异的是，岛上并没有一缕显示人迹的炊烟，整个的海岸上，丝毫也没有有人的迹象：
然而纸条上写得很清楚，这里有一个遇难的人，而且他一定在等待着。
这时候，乘风破浪号穿过礁石，驶进了曲曲折折的海峡，潘克洛夫十分小心地注意着每一个弯曲部分。他让赫伯特掌着舵，自己站在船头，察看海水，手里握着帆索，随时准备下帆。吉丁•史佩莱拿着望远镜，焦急地向海岸了望，然而什么也没有发现。
十二点钟的时候，乘风破浪号的船身终于碰到陆地了。水手们抛下船锚，把帆收起来，然后登岸。
毫无疑问，这就是达抱岛，因为根据最新的航海地图，在新西兰和美洲之间的这一带太平洋上，再也没有其他的岛屿了。
他们把船牢牢地系好，以防退潮的时候海水把它冲走，然后潘克洛夫和他的伙伴们全副武装，踏上了海岸，打算爬到半英里以外一座二百五十至三百英尺高的小山上去。
“站在那座小山的顶上，”史佩莱说，“我们先看清岛的全貌，然后再搜查就方便得多了。”
“史密斯先生在林肯岛上的第一件事，就是爬上富兰克林山，”赫伯特说，“我们在这里也这么做。”
“一点也不错，”通讯记者说，“这是最好的行动方针。”
探险家们一面说，一面在一块空地上往前走，这块空地一直伸晨到小山脚下。成群的野鸽和海鸥在他们周围振翼飞翔，看来都和林肯岛上的差不多。空地的左边也是一片丛林，他们听见灌木丛里有沙沙的响声，野草也在摆动，说明里面藏着什么胆小的动物；然而还是看不出岛上有人。
到了山脚下以后，潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特只费了几分钟，就爬到山上去了，他们急切地环视着水平线。
他们所在的这个小岛，周围不过六英里，海角、地岬、港湾和河流都很少，样子是个拉长的椭圆形。四面一直到天边都是单调的大海，看不见一片陆地，也看不见一叶孤帆。
这个树木丛生的小岛和林肯岛不同，林肯岛有的地方荒芜贫瘠，有的地方丰饶富庶，变化很多。相反地，这里到处都是绿荫，其中也有两三座小山，然而都不高。一条河流斜躺在椭圆形的海岛上，通过一大片草地，向西流入大海、入海的地方河口很窄。
“这个海岛的面积很小。”赫伯特说。
“是的，”潘克洛夫接着说。“对我们说来，嫌太小了些。”
“并且，”通讯记者说，“岛上好象并没有人。”
“的确，”赫伯特答道，“丝毫也看不出有人居住的迹象。”
“下山去，”潘克洛夫说，“搜查搜查。”
水手和他的两个伙伴下了山，回到停泊乘风破浪号的地方。
在深入内陆以前，他们决定徒步环绕海岛巡视一周，这样在搜查的时候，就不会遗漏任何地方了。沿着海滩走起来并不困难，只有几处有大岩石拦住道路，可是他们毫不费力就绕过去了。探险家们向南进发，他们惊起了大群的海鸟和海豹，海豹一看见远处有人来，立刻就跳下水去。
“这里的海豹，”通讯记者说，“已经不是第一次看见人了，它们怕人，说明它们对人是了解的。”
他们走了一个钟头，到了小岛的南端，这里的尽头是一个突出的海角；然后沿着西岸往北前进，这一带也是沙石海岸，背后衬托着一片茂密的丛林。
步行了四个钟头，把整个的海岛都搜遍了，然而无论哪里都没有住人的迹象，海滩上也找不到一个人的脚印。
他们不得不认为达抱岛上没有人，或是现在已经没有人，这一点是非常奇怪的。也许那张纸条是几个月甚至几年以前写的，因此遇难的人不是已经返回祖国，就是悲惨地死去了。
潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特一面猜测——这些猜测多少是有些可能的——一面在乘风破浪号上赶快吃饭，以便在天黑以前继续搜索。吃完饭，已经是傍晚五点钟，他们立刻进入了森林。
许多动物一看见他们都四散逃跑，其中主要的是山羊和猪，一看就知道它们是欧洲种。
毫无疑问，曾经有捕鲸船到过这里，这些猪羊就是船上留下，然后在岛上繁殖起来的。赫伯特决定要活捉一两只带回林肯岛去。
现在已经可以肯定这个小岛曾经有人来过。更充分的证据是：森林里的道路好象被践踏过，树木有很多被用斧砍倒，到处都有人类双手劳动的遗迹；然而树木都是多年以前砍倒的，已经腐朽了，木头上被斧头砍过的地方长满了绒状的青苔，而且道路上丛生着很深的荒草，很难找到树桩。
“可是，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“这不但能证明有人到岛上来过，而且还能证明他们在岛上住过一个时期。这些人究竟是谁，他们还有多少人留在这里呢？”
“根据纸条上所说的，”赫伯特说，“只有一个遇难的人。”
“好吧，如果他还在岛上，”潘克洛夫说，“我们是不会找不到他的。”
她们继续往前搜查。水手和他的伙伴们自然而然地沿着通往大海的河流，斜穿海岛，往前走去。
如果欧洲种的动物和双手劳动的遗迹可以作为有人到岛上来过的铁证，那么这里的某种植物也同样能说明这一点。有些地方，在林间的空地上，显然曾经种过食用的蔬菜，论时间大概也是在很久以前。
特别使赫伯特高兴的是，他发现了许多马铃薯、菊苣、酸模、胡萝卜、白菜和芜菁，只要搜集一些它们的种籽，就可以拿到林肯岛的土地上去播种了。
“好极了，哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道。“这些东西对纳布合适，对我们也合适。就算我们找不到遇难的人，这次航行也不算白来，真是天保佑我们。”
“不错，”吉丁•史佩莱说：“不过根据我们所发现的这片开垦地的情况看来，恐怕岛上已经很久没有人住了。”
“的确，”赫伯特说，“不管是什么样的居民，他决不会不照料这么重要的农作物的！”
“是的，”潘克洛夫说，“遇难人已经走了……我们只好这样假定……”
“只好认为纸条是很久以前写的了，是吗？”
“当然。”
“照这么说，瓶子是在海里漂了很久，才到林肯岛附近的。”
“那有什么不可能呢？”潘克洛夫说，“天晚了，”他接着说，“我认为现在最好停止搜查。”
“我们回船去吧，明天再重新开始，”通讯记者说。
这是最好的办法，他们正打算回去，突然赫伯特指着树木间的一团黑影叫道：
“一所房子！”
三个人立刻一起向房子跑去。在苍茫的暮色中，勉强能看出这是个用木板钉成的房子，上面盖着一层厚厚的防雨布。潘克洛夫一个箭步冲过去，推开了半掩的门。房子是空的！
Book 2 Chapter 14
Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of the darkness.
Pencroft shouted loudly.
No reply was made.
The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for a minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was a rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry wood. Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave forth a bright light.
The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of which the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for a long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered with rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor's clothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which was broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still untouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly covered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.
"There is no one here," said the reporter.
"No one," replied Pencroft.
"It is a long time since this room has been inhabited," observed Herbert.
"Yes, a very long time!" answered the reporter.
"Mr. Spilett," then said Pencroft, "instead of returning on board, I think that it would be well to pass the night in this hut."
"You are right, Pencroft," answered Gideon Spilett, "and if its owner returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken possession of."
"He will not return," said the sailor, shaking his head.
"You think that he has quitted the island?" asked the reporter.
"If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and his tools," replied Pencroft. "You know the value which castaways set on such articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!" repeated the sailor, in a tone of conviction; "no, he has not left the island! If he had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left these indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!"
"Living?" asked Herbert.
"Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself, and so we shall at least find his remains!"
It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm it. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there, seated on a bench, talking little but wondering much. They were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or expect anything. They listened eagerly for sounds outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and a man presented himself to them without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding all that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands ready to press the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were waiting.
But no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed away.
How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert alone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They were all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before, and to search the most secret recesses of the islet! The inferences deduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain that, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were still there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that they should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian burial.
Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey the dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation, at the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent gum-trees. Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared a wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a lawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on the left of which was the mouth of the stream.
The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these planks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the island, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that by means of the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had built the dwelling.
And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having walked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which had formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half effaced:
BR--TAN--A
"Britannia," exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; "it is a common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or American!"
"It matters very little, Pencroft!"
"Very little indeed," answered the sailor, "and we will save the survivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may belong. But before beginning our search again let us go on board the 'Bonadventure'."
A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel. Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken possession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable supposition. At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on board. The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile. They set out on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats and pigs fled in hundreds.
Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached the western coast of the island, and saw the "Bonadventure" held fast by her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.
Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this vessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy when there is no occasion for it.
They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary to dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration was continued and conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was very probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished. It was therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that Pencroft and his companions searched. But their searches were vain, and during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild beast had probably devoured it to the last bone.
"We will set off to-morrow at daybreak," said Pencroft to his two companions, as about two o'clock they were resting for a few minutes under the shade of a clump of firs.
"I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which belonged to the castaway," added Herbert.
"I think so, too," returned Gideon Spilett, "and these arms and tools will make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot is also most important."
"Yes," replied Pencroft, "but we must not forget to capture a couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute."
"Nor to gather those seeds," added Herbert, "which will give us all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds."
"Then perhaps it would be best," said the reporter, "to remain a day longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us."
"No, Mr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "I will ask you to set off to-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair wind for going back."
"Then do not let us lose time," said Herbert, rising.
"We won't waste time," returned Pencroft. "You, Herbert, go and gather the seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that, Mr. Spilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope we shall manage to catch a few!"
Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part of the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.
Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals, which were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow themselves to be approached.
However, after an hour's chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from the north part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible yells, in which there was nothing human.
Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs by this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was getting ready the rope to bind them.
"That's Herbert's voice," said the reporter.
"Run!" exclaimed Pencroft.
And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from whence the cries proceeded.
They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being, apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm.
To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for Pencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster's resistance he was firmly tied so that he could not even move.
"You are not hurt, Herbert?" asked Spilett.
"No, no!"
"Oh, if this ape had wounded him!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"But he is not an ape," answered Herbert.
At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being, a man. But what a man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the word, and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree of brutishness!
Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if made of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be called a man. But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in this body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!
"Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?" said Pencroft to the reporter.
"Alas! there is no doubt about it," replied Spilett.
"Then this must be the castaway?" asked Herbert.
"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but the unfortunate man has no longer anything human about him!"
The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had ever been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse, perhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat between his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh.
Memory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he had forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to make a fire! It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the physical qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral qualities. Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did not appear to understand or even to hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought he could see that all reason was not extinguished in him. However, the prisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he overwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he found in some corner of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled him to humanity? If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain? They could not tell, but they did not make the experiment; and after gazing attentively at the miserable creature,--
"Whoever he may be," remarked Gideon Spilett, "whoever he may have been, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to Lincoln Island."
"Yes, yes!" replied Herbert, "and perhaps with care we may arouse in him same gleam of intelligence."
"The soul does not die," said the reporter, "and it would be a great satisfaction to rescue one of God's creatures from brutishness."
Pencroft shook his head doubtfully.
"We must try at any rate," returned the reporter; "humanity commands us."
It was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three felt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their acting thus.
"Shall we leave him bound?" asked the sailor.
"Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened," said Herbert.
"Let us try," replied Pencroft.
The cords which shackled the prisoner's feet were cut off, but his arms remained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest any desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow, or at least having been so. A continual hissing sound issued from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt to resist.
By the reporter's advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut. Perhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some impression on him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his obscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul. The dwelling was not far off. In a few minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner remembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness of everything.
What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this miserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet dated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a rational being solitude had reduced him to this condition.
The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have some effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that attract even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame seemed at first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon he turned away and the look of intelligence faded. Evidently there was nothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board the "Bonadventure." This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft's charge.
Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after they came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of vegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.
All was embarked, and the "Bonadventure" was ready to weigh anchor and sail with the morning tide.
The prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet, silent, apparently deaf and dumb.
Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked meat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But on the sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he pounced on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily.
"You think that he will recover his senses?" asked Pencroft. "It is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is solitude that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he will be no longer alone."
"The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time," said Herbert.
"Perhaps," answered Gideon Spilett.
"About what age is he?" asked the lad.
"It is difficult to say," replied the reporter, "for it is impossible to see his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is no longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty."
"Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?" asked Herbert.
"Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could expect from his appearance."
"However, we shall see," replied Pencroft, "and I am anxious to know what opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look for a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we did what we could."
The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not move. He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its capture, and becomes wild again afterwards.
At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather predicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest favored the return of the "Bonadventure," but at the same time it freshened, which might render navigation more difficult.
At five o'clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail straight for Lincoln Island.
The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner remained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction. Did some recollection of his former calling return to him? However that might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than depressed.
The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north, consequently in a less favorable direction for the "Bonadventure." Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying anything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which frequently broke over the bows. Certainly, if the wind did not moderate, it would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to make Tabor Island.
Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the "Bonadventure" had been forty- eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the island. It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed, or to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been very irregular.
Twenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was right ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close-reefed, and they tacked frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the "Bonadventure"; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing themselves to the deck, they would have been carried away.
On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with loosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor's instinct had suddenly returned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which filled the deck escape. Then the vessel being clear, he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word. Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.
Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear that he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering his course.
The night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o'clock, the wind fell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored less, greatly increased.
Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour's sleep. They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the "Bonadventure," carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree, yet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller he anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them.
About two o'clock in the morning he started forward,--
"A light! a light!" he shouted.
Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding, showed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too much to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire, which burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first magnitude.
潘克洛夫、赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱，在黑暗里静悄悄地站着。
潘克洛夫大喊了几声。
没有回答。
水手点着了一根小树枝。一会儿，树枝照亮了这个小房间，看来屋里完全是空的。房间的后面是一个粗陋的壁炉，炉里有一些残灰，上面放着一抱干柴，潘克洛夫把燃烧的树枝扔上去，木柴就噼噼啪啪地燃烧起来了。
这时，水手和他的两个伙伴才发现房里有一张零乱的床铺，潮湿、发黄的被单可以说明很久没有使用了。壁炉的一角放着两把已经生锈的水壶和一只复着的铁锅。碗柜里放着几件水手的衣服，都已经生了霉；桌上有一个锡饭具，还有一本《圣经》，已经受潮腐蚀了；墙角里有几件工具，有一把铲子、一把鹤嘴锄和两支猎枪，一支猎枪已经损坏，在一个用木板做的架子上，放着一桶还没有动用过的火药、一桶枪弹和几匣雷管，所有这些东西都蒙着厚厚的、大概是经年累积起来的尘土。
“这里没有人。”通讯记者说。
“没有人。”潘克洛夫答道。
“这间房里很久没有住人了。”赫伯特说。
“是的，很久了！”通讯记者答道。
“史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫接着说，“我想我们不必回船去了，就在这房子里过夜倒不错。”
“你说得对，潘克洛夫，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“即使屋主回来，嘿！他大概也不会反对有人占用他的屋子的。”
“他不会回来的。”水手摇头说道。
“你认为他已经离开这个岛了吗？”通讯记者问道。
“如果他离开海岛，一定会把他的武器和工具带走的，”潘克洛夫回答说。“这些是难船上唯一遗留下来的东西，你不知道遇难的人是多么重视这些东西的吗？不！不会的！”水手肯定地重复道，“不，他没有离开海岛！如果他自己造了一只船，离开这里，他更不会留下这些一时也不能少的必需品了。不！他还在岛上！”
“还活着吗？”赫伯特问道。
“也许死了，也许还活着。可是如果他死了，我想他是不会自己埋自己的，我们至少可以找到他的尸体！”
于是他们决定在这已经没有人了的住所里过夜，墙角那堆木柴足够维持室内的温暖。关上门以后，潘克洛夫、赫伯特和史佩莱就在凳子上坐了下来，他们话谈得很少，然而想得却很多。他们幻想着各种各样事情，也等待着这些事情出现。他们急切地想听到外面的响动。可能突然有人推门进来，在他们的面前一站；虽然这所房屋完全象是被遗弃了似的，但是如果有上述的情况发生，他们还是丝毫也不会感到惊讶：他们随时准备和这个陌生的遇难友人握手，这群友人正在等待着他。
但是，没有人声，门也没有打开。时间就这样过去了。
这一夜对水手和他的伙伴们说来，是多么长啊！只有赫伯特睡了两个钟头，因为他的年龄，正是需要睡眠的时候，他们三个人都急着想继续昨天的探险，急着要搜索小岛上最隐蔽的角落！潘克洛夫的推论是完全合理的，由于房屋被遗弃，而工具、器皿和武器却还留在这里，因此几乎可以肯定，房主人已经死了。于是大家同意去找他的尸体，至少要给他举行基督教徒的丧葬仪式。
天亮了，潘克洛夫和他的伙伴们立刻开始查看这所屋子。这所房屋盖在一个非常适宜的地方，它在一座小山的背后，有五六棵美丽的橡胶树覆盖着它。房屋的前面是树林，中间有一块用斧头开辟出来的宽敞的空地，因此从房屋里可以一直望见大海。这片空地是一小片空地，四面围着一排东倒西歪的木栅栏，空地一直延伸到海边，海岸的左边就是河口。
房屋是用木板盖的，一看就知道，这些木板原来是一只船的船壳和甲板。大概这只破船漂流到小岛的海岸上，至少有一个水手逃出性命，他就用手头的工具，利用难船的残骸盖成这所房屋。
吉丁•史佩莱进一步证实了这个假定：他在屋子里来回踱了一会，在一块木板上看见几个已经模糊不清的字迹，这块木板大概原来是难船的外壳：上面写着：
“不……颠……”
“不列颠尼亚，”潘克洛夫被通讯记者叫来以后一看，喊道；“这一般是船的名字，不过我没法肯定它是英国船还是美国船！”
“这倒没有什么关系，潘克洛夫！”
“不错，”水手说；“如果船上脱险的水手还活着，不管他是哪一国人，我们都要救他。可是在重新搜查以前，我们还是先回乘风破浪号去一趟。”
潘克洛夫下意识地对他的船放心不下。也许岛上真的有人，也许有人占了……可是他又想到这种假定一点根据也没有，就耸了耸肩。不管怎么样，水手还是愿意回船去吃早饭的。这一段已经走过的路并不远，几乎还不到一英里。他们一面走，一面察看丛林深处，只见上百只的山羊和猪在里面奔窜。
离开房屋二十分钟以后，潘克洛夫和他的伙伴来到了小岛的东岸，只见乘风破浪号还好好地停在那儿，船锚深深地陷在沙滩里。
潘克洛夫不禁松了一口气。这只船可以算得是他的孩子，而闲来挂念子女则是父亲的权利。
他们回到船上，吃了早饭，吃得足以支持到很晚再吃中饭；吃完以后，他们就继续探险，这次搜查得非常仔细。的确，岛上唯一的居民很可能已经死了。因此，潘克洛夫和他的伙伴们主要是找死人而不是找活人的踪迹。然而搜查的结果还是徒劳无功，这一天上午，他们在覆盖小岛的密林里什么也没有找到。现在几乎已经可以肯定，如果说遇难的人已经死了，却又找不到他的残骸，那么，多半是由于野兽把它连骨头都吃光了。
“明天早上天一亮我们就动身，”潘克洛夫对他的两个伙伴说，这时候大约两点钟，他们正在一丛枞树的浓荫下，作几分钟的休息。
“我觉得我们可以把遇难人的器皿拿回去，这也不算亏心。”赫伯特补充道。
“我也同意，”吉丁•史佩莱说；“这些武器和工具可以把‘花岗石宫’的仓库充实起来。补充枪弹和火药也是非常重要的。”
“是的，”潘克洛夫说；“可是我们不要忘记，还要捉一两对猪，这是林肯岛所没有的……”
“也不要忘记搜集种籽，”赫伯特补充道，“它可以使我们得到新旧大陆的各种蔬菜。”
“那么我们最好还是在达抱岛上多呆一天，”通讯记者说，“这样就可以把对我们有用的东西搜集齐了。”
“不，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫说，“我还是主张明天一早就动身。我觉得风向很可能转往西面；我们来的时候一帆风顺，回去的时候最好还是一帆风顺。”
“那么就不要浪费时间吧。”赫伯特站起身来说。
“我们不会浪费时间的，”潘克洛夫说。“赫伯特，你去搜集种籽，因为你比我们内行，你搜集种籽的时候，史佩莱先生和我去猎猪，虽然没有托普，我想我们还是可以想法子捉住几只的！”
于是赫伯特就一直向小岛上生长着农作物的地方走去，水手和通讯记者进入了丛林。
许多种和猪差不多的动物在他们前面奔逃，动作非常灵活，似乎很难接近它们。
追赶了半个钟头，猎人们终于把躺在密林里的一对猪抓住了，可是正在这时候，他们突然听见海岛北部约莫百米光景的地方传来一阵呼喊声。喊声里还夹杂着可怕的尖叫，听起来简直不象是从人的嗓子里发出来的。
潘克洛夫和吉丁•史佩莱拔脚就跑，水手原来已经准备好绳子捆猪，这时候也让它们乘机逃脱了。
“是赫伯特的声音。”通讯记者说。
“快跑！”潘克洛夫喊道。
水手和史佩莱急忙向发出喊声的地方拼命跑去。
幸亏他们跑得快，一转弯，他们就看见少年被一个野人按倒在一块空地上。这个野人看起来象是一只巨大的人猿，正打算伤害赫伯特。
说时迟，那时快；潘克洛夫和吉丁•史佩莱马上向这个怪物扑过去，把他反过来按倒在地上，从他手里救出赫伯特，然后把他牢牢地绑起来。水手是个天生的大力士，吉丁•史佩莱也是一条壮汉，怪物挣扎了一会儿，到底被紧紧地缚住，动弹不得了。
“你受伤了吗，赫伯特？”史佩莱问道。
“没有，没有！”
“啊，要是让人猿把他伤害了，那就……！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“他不是人猿呀。”赫伯特说。
潘克洛夫和吉丁•史佩莱听了以后，看了一下躺在地上的怪物。果然，他不是人猿，而是一个人。可是这个人的样子多么凶恶呀！这是一个可怕得难以形容的野人，尤其令人毛发悚然的是，他似乎已经残暴到完全丧失人性了！
乱蓬蓬的头发，一直垂到胸前的胡须，赤身裸体，仅仅在腰间围了一块破布，野性未驯的眼睛，一双指甲极长的大手，颜色和红木一般的皮肤，硬得和牛角似的双脚——这就是这个怪东西的形象，然而他毕竟还得叫做人。可是人们不妨这样问：在他的躯体内，究竟是人类的心灵，还是动物的兽性？
“你能肯定这是个人，或者曾经是个人吗？”潘克洛夫对通讯记者说。
“嗨！这是没有问题的，”史佩菜答道。
“那么，他一定就是遇难的人了？”赫伯特问道。
“是的，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是这个不幸的人已经完全丧失人性了！”
通讯记者说得对。即使这个遇难的人曾经是文明人，肯定他说，孤独的生活也已经使他变成一个野人，更糟的是，也许使他变成一个人猿。他紧咬着牙，喉咙里发出沙哑的声音，牙齿非常锐利，和野兽用来吃生肉的利齿一样。
他一定早就丧失了记忆，很久以来，他已忘记了怎样使用枪械和工具，连火也不会生了！看得出来他非常灵活敏捷，然而体力发达却引起智力退化。吉丁•史佩莱和他说了几句话。他好象不懂，甚至好象根本没有听。然而通讯记者从他的眼睛里看得出来，他似乎并没有完全丧失理智。俘虏不挣扎，也不想摆脱自己的束缚。他过去也曾是人类的一分子，现在看见人，是不是感情过于激动了呢？是不是他的脑海里突然闪过一些记忆，重新恢复了人性呢？如果让他自由，他会不会逃跑，还要留在这里呢？这说不定，他们也没有试一试，吉丁•史佩莱向他打量了很久，然后说：
“不管他现在是什么，过去是什么，将来会成为什么，我们都有责任把他带回林肯岛去。”
“对，对！”赫伯特说；“我们小心照料他，也许能启发他恢复一线智慧之光的。”
“灵魂是不会死的，”通讯记者说；“如果能把一个人从愚昧中拯救出来，这才是一件值得高兴的事。”
潘克洛夫怀疑地摇了摇头。
“总之，我们一定要试试看，”通讯记者说；“人道要求我们这样做。”
的确，作为基督徒和文明人，这是他们的责任。他们三个人全知道这一点，而且他们深信赛勒斯•史密斯也一定会同意这种做法。
“就让他老绑着吗？”水手问道。
“如果放松他的脚，他也许能走的。”赫伯特说。
“我们试试看。”潘克洛夫说。
他们割断了俘虏脚上的绳子，然而还是牢牢地绑着他的两手。他自己站起身来，没有要逃跑的意思。他们走到他身边去，那双冷酷的眼睛狠狠地看了一下这三个人；然而他好象丝毫也不记得自己和他们是同类，或者至少曾经是同类。他的唇边不时发出咝咝的声音，他的外貌非常野蛮，但是他并没有打算反抗。
在通讯记者的建议下，把这个不幸的人带到小屋里去。也许看见自己的东西，他会有所感悟的！也许星星之火可以照亮他那陷于混沌的智慧，可以使他麻木了的灵魂重新活跃起来。房屋并不远。几分钟以后，他们就走到了，然而俘虏什么也不记得，似乎对任何东西都失去感觉了。
这个可怜的人初来的时候也许还有理性，大概是经过在小岛上长期困守，孤独才把他变成现在这样的；除此以外，他们再也没法想象他怎么会退化到这么野蛮的程度了。
通讯记者又想到，让他看看火光，也许会产生一些效果。片刻以后，炉膛里就燃起了一堆熊熊的烈火，这种美丽的火焰，往往连野兽也会被吸引过来。起初，炉火似乎引起了这个不幸的人的注意，可是他随即转过身去，眼睛里智慧的光芒也消失了。显然，目前没有别的办法可想，只有把他带到乘风破浪号上去。他们就这么办了，潘克洛夫留在船上看管他。
赫伯特和史佩莱又到岸上去继续做他们没有做完的工作；过了几个钟头，他们回到海边，带来了器皿、枪枝，大量的蔬菜和种籽，不少野味和两对猪。
大家都上了船，只等早上涨潮，乘风破浪号就要起锚开船了。
俘虏被放在前仓，他一言不发地呆在那里，非常安静，象个聋子或是哑巴似的。
潘克洛夫递了一些熟肉给他吃，被他一手推开了，毫无疑问，这些东西不合乎他的胃口。可是他一看见潘克洛夫在他面前拿出一只鸭子——那是赫伯特打来的——就象野兽似的抓过去，狼吞虎咽地把它吃下去了。
“你认为他会恢复理智吗？”潘克洛夫摇着头问道。
“可能，”通讯记者回答说，“只要我们小心看护，也许会产生一些效果的；孤独把他变成现在这个样子，从现在起，他就不再孤独了。”
“这个可怜的人这种样子一定已经很久了。”赫伯特说。
“也许。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“他大概有多大年纪？”少年问道。
“很难说，”通讯记者说，“他满脸都是浓胡子，看不清他的真面貌！可是他的年纪已经不轻了，我想他可能有五十岁左右。”
“你注意到没有？史佩莱先生，他的眼睛陷得多么深啊！”赫伯特说。
“是的，赫伯特；可是我要补充一句，和他的外表比起来，他的眼睛还显得有些人性。”
“不论怎么样，我们等着瞧吧，”潘克洛夫说，“我倒很想知道史密斯先生对我们这位野人的看法。我们来找的是人，带回去的却是一个妖怪！不过我们总算尽了自己的力量了。”
这一夜过去了，他们都不知道俘虏睡觉没有，可是，虽然解除了他的束缚，他并没有动。他好象野兽那样，被捉住的时候，最初有些发楞，过些时野性又发作起来了。
第二天是10月15日，正象潘克洛夫预言的那样，早上天一亮，天气就起了变化。风向转往西北，这对乘风破浪号的归航是有利的，可是同时天气也愈来愈冷，这给航行却增加许多困难。
清晨五点钟起锚。潘克洛夫收缩了主帆，朝着东北，直向林肯岛驶去。
第一天，航行中没有发生任何事故。俘虏安静地呆在前仓；他曾经是个水手，也许船身的颠簸会引起他良好的反应。他回忆起过去的职业来了吗？然而他始终是安安静静地呆在那里，看样子他不感觉郁闷，只是有些惊讶。
第二天风势更强，北风愈来愈大，结果使乘风破浪号掌握不住正确方向。不久以后，潘克洛夫只好抢风而行，海浪一再地打到船头上来，他虽然一句话也没有说，但是对海里的情况却感到有些不安。如果风势不缓和下来，肯定地说，回林肯岛的时间就要比到达抱岛来的时间长了。
果然，乘风破浪号在海里航行了两天两夜，到17日的清晨，还是看不见林肯岛的影子。由于航行的速度时快时慢，因此，既不可能估计出已经走了多远，又不可能知道准确的方向。
又过了二十四小时，还是看不见陆地。狂风迎面刮来，海上波涛汹涌。船上的帆篷紧缩着，他们不时地变换方向。18日那天，一个大浪整个地冲着乘风破浪号盖下来，要不是水手们预先把自己绑在甲板上，他们就要被海浪卷走了。
潘克洛夫和他的伙伴们正在忙着解脱自己身上的束缚，出乎意外地，这时候俘虏竟来帮助他们，他似乎突然恢复了水手的本能，从仓口里跑出来，用一根圆材打穿了一块舷壁，使甲板上的水往外流去。等船里的水流完以后，他又不言不语地走下自己的仓去。潘克洛夫、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特非常惊讶地看着他进行工作。
他们的处境的确是严重的，水手非常担忧，而且这种担忧并不是毫无理由，他们深怕已经在大海中迷失了方向，再也不可能找到原路了。
夜晚非常昏暗和寒冷。直到十一点钟的时候，风势才减弱，大海也平静了；由于船身不再那样颠簸，速度大大地加快了。
潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特都不想睡。他们小心翼翼地守望着。摆在他们面前的有两种可能，不是离林肯岛不远，破晓的时候可以看见它，就是乘风破浪号被海流冲到极远的地方，再也回不到正确的航线上去了。潘克洛夫的性情向来是乐观的，这时他虽然心里很烦躁，却并没有失望；他紧紧握着舵柄，恨不得一下子穿透周围的黑暗。
早上两点钟的时候，他忽然往前跳起来，大声喊道：
“光！光！”
果然，在东北二十海里以外的地方，有一点亮光，林肯岛就在那里，显然这是赛勒斯•史密斯燃起的野火，给他们指点着航行的方向。潘克洛夫的航线过于偏北了，于是他掉过头来，直向有光的地方驶去。火光在水平线上燃烧，象一颗一等星以的，明亮地照耀着。
Book 2 Chapter 15
The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o'clock in the morning, after a voyage of four days, the "Bonadventure" gently glided up to the beach at the mouth of the Mercy.
Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of the vessel which had been so long in returning.
"God be praised! there they are!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding.
As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his hands and shouting, "Oh! my master!" A more touching pantomime than the finest discourse.
The engineer's first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the "Bonadventure," was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his island and change one prison for another.
Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of the "Bonadventure."
The moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on the beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand, Harding said: "We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did you meet with any accident?"
"No," replied Gideon Spilett; "on the contrary, everything went wonderfully well. We will tell you all about it."
"However," returned the engineer, "your search has been unsuccessful, since you are only three, just as you went!"
"Excuse me, captain," replied the sailor, "we are four."
"You have found the castaway?"
"Yes."
"And you have brought him?"
"Yes."
"Living?"
"Yes."
"Where is he? Who is he?"
"He is," replied the reporter, "or rather he was a man! There, Cyrus, that is all we can tell you!"
The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage, and under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only dwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway had been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human species.
"And that's just the point," added Pencroft, "I don't know if we have done right to bring him here."
"Certainly you have, Pencroft," replied the engineer quickly.
"But the wretched creature has no sense!"
"That is possible at present," replied Cyrus Harding, "but only a few months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you have found this poor creature in such a state!"
"But, captain," asked Herbert, "what leads you to think that the brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?"
"Because the document we found had been recently written," answered the engineer, "and the castaway alone can have written it."
"Always supposing," observed Gideon Spilett, "that it had not been written by a companion of this man, since dead."
"That is impossible, my dear Spilett."
"Why so?" asked the reporter.
"Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways," replied Harding, "and it mentioned only one."
Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner's mind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor.
"Well, Herbert," replied the engineer, "you are right to attach great importance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and despair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men, and since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!"
The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and the great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he occupied in the fore part of the "Bonadventure"; when once on land he manifested a wish to run away.
But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a gesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness. Immediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually became calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more resistance.
"Poor fellow!" murmured the engineer.
Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance this miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and yet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an indefinable trace of intelligence.
It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms of Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape. He was led there without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps, be hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in Lincoln Island.
Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare, as the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in detail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to the islet. He agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger must be either English or American, the name Britannia leading them to suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard, and under the shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon.
"But, by the bye," said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, "you never told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to help you!"
"Upon my word," answered Herbert, "it is rather difficult to say how it happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely had time to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt concealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you about it, and unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft--"
"My boy!" said Cyrus Harding, "you ran a great danger, but, perhaps, without that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from your search, and we should not have had a new companion."
"You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?" asked the reporter.
"Yes," replied the engineer.
Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and returned to the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the "Bonadventure," and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools, saw nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the stranger.
The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very profitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where they soon became at home.
The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box of caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small powder- magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern, where there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle was to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there was no reason for substituting ordinary powder.
When the unloading of the vessel was finished,--
"Captain," said Pencroft, "I think it would be prudent to put our 'Bonadventure' in a safe place."
"Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?" asked Cyrus Harding.
"No, captain," replied the sailor. "Half of the time she is stranded on the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return."
"Could she not float in the river?"
"No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the east winds, I think that the 'Bonadventure' would suffer much from the surf."
"Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?"
"In Port Balloon," replied the sailor. "That little creek, shut in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want."
"Is it not rather far?"
"Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a fine straight road to take us there!"
"Do it then, Pencroft, and take your 'Bonadventure' there," replied the engineer, "and yet I would rather have her under our more immediate protection. When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her."
"Famous!" exclaimed Pencroft. "A harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy."
"Yes, my brave Pencroft," answered the engineer, "but on condition, however, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our work."
Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the "Bonadventure," the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly towards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil waters of Port Balloon.
During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he already given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming tamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In short, was the soul returning to the body?
Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the reporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been totally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open air, to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw himself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House. But gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his movements.
They had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his carnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board the "Bonadventure." Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was sleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of mane and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more suitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him. The result was that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more human appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder. Certainly, when formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man's face must have had a sort of beauty.
Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours in his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in different things, so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be sufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain to recall reason. That had been seen, during the storm, on board the "Bonadventure!" The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so as to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the depths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions, sometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of things belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.
At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said, and the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them. Sometimes the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a proof that he suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken; but he did not speak, although at different times, however, they almost thought that words were about to issue from his lips. At all events, the poor creature was quite quiet and sad!
But was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result of his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists, to whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy, better fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature should gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new life? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable to him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his master? This was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious to answer, and yet he did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would he ever be a convalescent?
How the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for his soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it! The settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure undertaken by Harding. They aided him also in this work of humanity, and all, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope and his faith.
The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed a sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently felt. Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him to another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might perhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!
"But," said Gideon Spilett, "can we hope that he will not escape, if once set at liberty?"
"The experiment must be tried," replied the engineer.
"Well!" said Pencroft. "When that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!"
"I do not think so," returned Harding.
"Let us try," said Spilett.
"We will try," replied the engineer.
This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor Island had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was warm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and Pencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying near the window and gazing at the sky.
"Come, my friend," said the engineer to him.
The stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and he followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident as to the result of the experiment.
Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in the lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before Granite House. The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united on the beach.
The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him at liberty.
He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with extreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape. He was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on the sand.
"This is only the sea," observed Gideon Spilett, "and possibly it does not inspire him with any wish to escape!"
"Yes," replied Harding, "we must take him to the plateau, on the border of the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive."
"Besides, he could not run away," said Neb, "since the bridge is raised."
"Oh!" said Pencroft, "that isn't a man to be troubled by a stream like Creek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!"
"We shall soon see," Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes not quitting those of his patient.
The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing the left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.
Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.
The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement to escape!
And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the creek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an instant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half sank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes.
"Ah!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding, "you have become a man again, for you can weep!"
第二天是10月20日，乘风破浪号航行了四天，终于在这天早上七点钟，慢慢地向慈悲河口的沙滩驶来了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和纳布对于变天和伙伴们的迟迟不归感到非常不安，天一亮他们就爬上了眺望岗，最后终于看见这只误期的船了。
“谢天谢地！他们到底回来了！”赛勒斯•史密斯大声说。
纳布更是非常高兴，他跳起舞来，转着身子，拍手喊道，“啊！我的主人！”看他那副模样，比听最好的演说还要动人
工程师起初推测遇难的人不在乘风破浪号的甲板上，他认为不是潘克洛夫没有找到达抱岛上的遇难人，就是这个不幸的人不愿意离开他的岛换一个困守的地方。
果然，乘风破浪号的甲板上只有潘克洛夫、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特三个人。
工程师早就和纳布在沙滩上等着了，船刚靠岸，史密斯不等旅客们上岸，就说：“你们到现在才回来，真把我们急坏了，朋友们！你们遇到什么意外了吗？”
“没有，”吉丁•史佩莱答道；“相反的，一切都很顺利。经过的情况我们全都要告诉你们的。”
“可是，”工程师说，“你们的搜索却没有成功，去的时候是三个人，回来还是三个人！”
“对不起，史密斯先生，”水手说，“我们是四个人。”
“你们找到遇难的人了吗？”
“是的。”
“你们把他带回来了吗？”
“是的。”
“活的吗？”
“是的。”
“他在哪儿？是什么人？”
“他是，”通讯记者答道，“说得更正确些，他过去是一个人！赛勒斯，我们所能答复你的只能是这样！”
然后他把探险的全部经过和搜查时的各种情况都告诉了工程师，岛上唯一的房屋怎样长期地被遗弃着没有人住，怎样最后捉住了这个已经不象人的遇难者。
“问题就在这儿，”潘克洛夫接着说，“我不知道我们该不该把他带回来。”
“当然应该，潘克洛夫。”工程师很快地说。
“可是这个可怜的家伙不懂人事！”
“目前可能是这样，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“但仅仅几个月以前，这个可怜的家伙还和我们一样，是一个人呢。要是我们之中有谁长期孤独地留住在这个岛上，谁知道他会变成什么样子呢？剩下孤单单的一个人是最大的不幸！朋友们，既然你们发现这个可怜的家伙变得这样，我们就应该相信，孤独能够很快地摧残人的理智！”
“可是，史密斯先生，”赫伯特问道，“你怎么会认为这个不幸的人是最近几个月才变得这么野蛮的呢？”
“因为我们发现的那张纸条是最近才写的，”工程师答道，“而写这张纸条的又只能是这个遇难的人。”
“也可能是这个人的一个已经死了的伙伴写的。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“那是不可能的，亲爱的史佩莱。”
“为什么？”通讯记者问道。
“如果是那样的话，纸条上就会提到有两个遇难的人了。”史密斯答道，“可是它只提到一个人。”
然后赫伯特简单地叙述了旅途中发生的事情，他详细地谈到在风暴正激烈的时候，俘虏突然变成水手的奇事，这说明他脑子里可能闪过什么念头。
“好，赫伯特，”工程师说，“你注意这件事很正确。这个不幸的人不是无法医治的，绝望把他变成这样，可是在这儿他遇见了他的同胞，他既然还有灵魂，我们就要挽救他的灵魂！”
他们把达抱岛上的遇难人从乘风破浪号的前仓里带了出来，工程师对他十分同情，而纳布则表示非常惊奇，刚上岸来，他就表现出有逃跑的意图。
可是赛勒斯•史密斯走过去，把一只手搁在他的肩膀上，样子显得非常威严，同时又以无限仁慈的目光看着他。这个可怜的人受了这种崇高感情的影响，马上就听从了，他逐渐安静下来，垂着眼睛，低下头，不再抗拒了。
“可怜的人！”工程师喃喃地说。
赛勒斯•史密斯长久地注视着他。单从外表来看，这个可怜的人已经完全不象个人了，然而也和通讯记者一样，史密斯发现他的眼睛里有一线不能用言语形容的智慧之光。
大家决定让这个遇难人，也就是陌生人——他的伙伴们从此都这么叫他——在“花岗石宫”里单独住一间房子，到那里他就逃不出去了。他们毫不困难地把他领到那里；经过细心的看护，也许有一天他会变成林肯岛上居民们的一个伙伴的。
通讯记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫都饿得要死，纳布急忙准备早饭；在吃饭的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯详细地听他们讲述了到小岛探险的全部经过。他同意伙伴们的看法，陌生人不是英国人就是美国人，他们由“不……颠……”这个名字可以联想到这一点；此外，从浓密的胡须和纠结蓬松的头发里，工程师还能隐约认出盎格鲁——萨克逊人的特征。
“可是，”吉丁•史佩莱对赫伯特说，“你一直没有跟我们说，你是怎样遇到这个野蛮人的；我们什么都不知道，只知道如果不是我们及时赶去救你，你就要被他掐死了！”
“嗳呀，”赫伯特答道，“我也说不清那是怎么回事。我记得当时我正在搜集植物，忽然听见轰咚一声，好象有什么东西从大树上掉下来似的。我几乎还没来得及转身，这个不幸的人——他无疑是藏在一棵树上的——比我现在嘴说还要快，一下子就扑在我的身上了，要不是史佩莱先生和潘克洛夫……”
“我的孩子！”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“你冒了极大的危险；可是，如果没有这次冒险，这个可怜的人也许还隐藏着不让你们找到，我们就不会有一个新的伙伴了。”
“那么，赛勒斯，你打算把他重新变成人吗？”通讯记者问道。
“是的。”工程师回答说。
吃完早饭，史密斯和他的伙伴们走出“花岗石宫”，又回到海滩来了。他们在那里忙着把乘风破浪号上的东西搬下来，工程师把武器和工具仔细地看了一遍，但是在任何东西上也找不到能证明陌生人身份的痕迹。
大家都认为小岛上捉来的猪对林肯岛非常有用，他们把猪送进猪圈，它们很快就在那里安居下来了。
两桶弹药和几匣雷管也很受欢迎。大家一致同意，在“花岗石宫”的外边或是上面的石洞里建立一个小型火药库，这样就可以不必担心爆炸了。棉花火药还可以继续使用，它的效果非常好，没有理由因为有了普通火药就不要它。
卸完货物以后，潘克洛夫说：
“史密斯先生，为了谨慎起见，我想最好把我们的乘风破浪号放在一个妥当的地方。”
“把它放在慈悲河口不妥当吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
“不行，史密斯先生，”水手答道。“要是放在慈悲河口，就要有一半时间使搁在沙滩上，那是会受磨损的。你要知道，它是一艘上好的名船，我们回来的时候，一路上遭到那么大的风浪袭击，它还是航行得很稳当。”
“不能让它浮在河上吗？”
“当然可以，史密斯先生；可是那里没有东西遮蔽，一刮东风，我相乘风破浪号就要遭到波浪的冲击了。”
“那么，你打算把它放在哪儿呢，潘克洛夫？”
“放在气球港，”水手答道。“那条小河外面有岩石挡着，我看做我们的港口正合适。”
“不嫌太远吗？”
“不！离‘花岗石宫’才不过三英里，再说，我们又有一条平坦大道通到那儿！”
“就这么办吧，潘克洛夫，把你的乘风破浪号送到那儿去，”工程师说，“可是我总想把它放在邻近的地方，我们好照管它。等我们有空，一定要给它筑一个港口。”
“好极了！”潘克洛夫叫道。“筑一个有灯塔，有码头，有船坞的港口！啊！史密斯先生，和你在一起，真是什么都好办。”
“是的，勇敢的潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“可是有一个条件，那就是需要你大力帮助，因为在我们所有的工作里，你都能够一个人干三个人的活。”
于是赫伯特和水手重新上了乘风破浪号，他们拨起锚，扯起帆，一阵风把它飞快地吹向爪角去。两个钟头以后，它就停泊在气球港平静的水面上了。
陌生人住在“花岗石宫”里已经有好几天了，居民们有没有根据说他的野性子已经慢慢驯化了呢？在他蒙蔽了的心灵深处，已经燃起更亮的火焰了吗？简单地说，他的灵魂已经返回肉体了吗？
是的，回答是肯定的，而且情况发展得很快，赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者简直不相信这个不幸的人曾经有过完全丧失理智的时候。陌生人在露天里生活惯了，在达抱岛上无拘无束，自由自在，因此初来的时候总是一言不发非常生气，大家都怕他从“花岗石宫”的窗口跳到沙滩上去。后来他逐渐平静下来，大家也就随着让他有更多的自由了。
他们对他抱着希望，而且是很大的希望，这完全是有理由的。陌生人已经忘记了茹毛饮血的本性，开始吃一些比小岛上的食物稍微文明一些的营养品；他现在看见熟肉，也不象在乘风破浪号上时那样起反感了。赛勒斯•史密斯乘他睡着的时候，给他剪短了头发和乱蓬蓬的胡子，这些须发象鬃毛似的，使他的相貌显得更加野蛮。他那遮身的破布也换成比较合适的衣服了。由于大家的照料，陌生人初步恢复了人的模样，仿佛连他的眼睛也显得比较温和了。肯定地说，当他过去脸上罩着智慧的光芒时，一定是相当漂亮的。
史密斯每天总要们这个伙伴在一起呆上几个钟头，，他走到陌生人旁边来，进行各种各样的工作，吸引他的注意。的确，星星之火就可以照亮他的心，脑海中的一点回忆就可以勾起他的理智，在乘风破浪号上中途遇到风暴的时候，这一点已经得到证明了！此外，工程师在说话的时候还特地放开嗓子，以便通过听觉和视觉来打动他那麻痹的心灵。有时候这个伙伴，有时候那个，有时候全体都和他一起进行这种工作。他们谈的最多的是和航海有关的事情。一个水手听了这些事情一定会感到兴趣的。
陌生人对他们的谈话常常表示有些注意，居民们不久就相信，他听得懂一部分。有时候他显得非常苦闷，说明他精神上很痛苦，这是不会错的，因为从他的表情上可以看得出来；有好几次，他们觉得他几乎就要开口说话了，结果他还是没有说什么。不管怎么样，这个可怜的人总是非常沉默和忧郁！
然而他的沉默会不会仅仅是表面的呢？他的忧郁会不会仅仅是由于孤独所造成的呢，现在还不能肯定。在一定的环境里，成天只看见有限的东西，接触的总是这几个移民——不久他就要惯于和他们生活在一起了——什么都不缺少，吃得饱，穿得暖，在这种情况下，他的习惯自然会一天天改变的；然而，他是不是喜欢这种新生活？或者，换句对他更恰当的话来说，他是不是会象畜生对它的主人那样“驯服”，这是一个重要的问题。赛勒斯•史密斯急于得到答案，可是他又不愿意草率地对待他的病人（在他看来，这陌生人就是一个病人）！他能慢慢地复原吗？
工程师随时都注意着他！不妨这样说，他在等待他的灵魂出现，并且随时准备抓住它！居民们都衷心地关怀着史密斯诊疗的每一步骤。他们也帮助他进行这项人道主义的工作，不久以后，也许潘克洛夫还表示怀疑，其他的人都和工程师一样，满怀信心和希望了。
正如前面所说的那样，陌生人非常安静；他甚至对工程师表示依恋，显然，他已经感受到工程师的影响了，于是赛勒斯•史密斯决定对他进行一次试验，他常常注视着眼前的海洋，现在要把他从大海的面前带到森林的边缘去，也许这一片绿树会使他回忆起多年来自己生活的地方！
“可是，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“如果一旦让他自由，他不会逃跑吗？”
“这正是要试一试的。”工程师答道。
“好吧！”潘克洛夫说。“这个家伙出去以后，呼吸到新鲜空气，非撒开两腿逃走不可！”
“我不相信。”史密斯说。
“我们试试看。”史佩莱说。
“试试看吧。”工程师答道。
这是10月30日的事情，达抱岛上的遇难人在“花岗石宫”里已经被监禁了九天。这一天天气很暖和，阳光明朗地照耀在海岛上。赛勒斯•史密斯和潘克洛夫走到陌生人的房间里去，只见他靠窗口躺着，凝视着天空。
“来吧，朋友。”工程师对他说。
陌生人马上就起来了。他注视着赛勒斯•史密斯，并且跟着他走，水手随着他们，对于这次试验不抱什么希望。
走到门口，史密斯和潘克洛夫帮助他进入升降梯，这时纳布、赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱已经在“花岗石宫”前面等着他们，升降梯下降了。几分钟以后，大家都集合在海滩上。
居民们走开了一些，让陌生人独自随便行动。
他向大海走了几步，容光顿时焕发起来，然而他一点也没有打算逃跑。他注视着被小岛隔断的、漫上沙滩来的一片细浪。
“这不过是海，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“看来这不会引起他逃跑的念头！”
“是的，”史密斯答道，“我们应该把他带到高地上的森林边缘去。在那里试验的结果就可以作为结论了。”
“他就是想跑也没法跑，”纳布说，“吊桥已经扯起来了。”
“呃！”潘克洛夫说，“这样的人是不在乎甘油河那样的小河的！他只要一跳，就能够过得去！”
“我们马上就可以知道了。”史密斯只是简单地说，他还是看着病人的眼睛。
于是陌生人被带到慈悲河口，大家爬上河的左岸，来到眺望岗上。
这里是森林的边缘，树木非常美丽，微风吹过，树叶微微有些摆动，他们来到这里，陌生人深深地呼了一口气，似乎贪婪地吸着大气里扑鼻的芬芳。
居民们紧跟在他的背后，随时防备着。如果他打算逃走，马上就可以把他抓住！
果然，这个可怜的人打算跳到他和森林之间的河流里去，一刹那间，他一蹲身，好象要纵身跳下去似的，可是几乎立刻又退了回来，在昏昏沉沉的状况中，一大颗泪珠从他的眼睛里掉下来了。
“啊！”赛勒斯•史密斯叫道，“你又变成人了，因为你能够流泪了！”
Book 2 Chapter 16
Yes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had flashed across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding's expression, by those tears he was once more a man.
The colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew themselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but he did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought him back to Granite House. Two days after this occurrence, the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life. He evidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely determined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft, listening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his lips:--
"No! here! I! never!"
The sailor reported these words to his companions.
"There is some painful mystery there!" said Harding.
The stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the garden. When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained retired within himself, but on the engineer's recommendation, they respected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the settlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs, as if overburdened!
Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe so, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,--
"If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious to be told!"
They must be patient and wait.
A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the plateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding, who was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again flowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the unfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly.
"My friend!" said he.
The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having endeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly.
"My friend," said Harding in a firmer voice, "look at me, I wish it!"
The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power, as a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away. But then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes flashed. Words struggled to escape from his lips. He could no longer contain himself! At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow voice,--"Who are you?" he asked Cyrus Harding.
"Castaways, like you," replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep. "We have brought you here, among your fellow-men."
"My fellow-men!. . . . I have none!"
"You are in the midst of friends."
"Friends!--for me! friends!" exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face in his hands. "No--never--leave me! leave me!"
Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and remained there a long time motionless.
Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just happened.
"Yes! there is some mystery in that man's life," said Gideon Spilett, "and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of remorse."
"I don't know what sort of a man we have brought here," said the sailor. "He has secrets--"
"Which we will respect," interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. "If he has committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes he is absolved."
For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under the influence of recollections which recalled all his past life--a melancholy life doubtless--and the colonists, without losing sight of him, did not attempt to disturb his solitude. However, after two hours, appearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding. His eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer. His countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous, ashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.
"Sir," said he to Harding, "your companions and you, are you English?"
"No," answered the engineer, "we are Americans."
"Ah!" said the stranger, and he murmured, "I prefer that!"
"And you, my friend?" asked the engineer.
"English," replied he hastily.
And as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the beach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.
Then, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled voice,--
"What month?" he asked.
"December," replied Herbert.
"What year?"
"1866."
"Twelve years! twelve years!" he exclaimed.
Then he left him abruptly.
Herbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had been made.
"This unfortunate man," observed Gideon Spilett, "was no longer acquainted with either months or years!"
"Yes!" added Herbert, "and he had been twelve years already on the islet when we found him there!"
"Twelve years!" rejoined Harding. "Ah! twelve years of solitude, after a wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man's reason!"
"I am induced to think," said Pencroft, "that this man was not wrecked on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left there."
"You must be right, Pencroft," replied the reporter, "and if it is so it is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to fetch him some day!"
"And they will no longer find him," said Herbert.
"But then," added Pencroft, "they must return, and--"
"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, "do not let us discuss this question until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has suffered, that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may have been, and that the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let us press him to tell us his history! He will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it, we shall see what course it will be best to follow. He alone besides can tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!"
"And why?" asked the reporter.
"Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that he was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see his fellow-creatures again!"
"But," observed the sailor, "there is one thing which I cannot explain."
"What is it?"
"If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may well suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in which we found him!"
"That is probable," replied Cyrus Harding.
"It must then be many years since he wrote that document!"
"No doubt," and yet the document appears to have been recently written!
"Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document may not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln Island?"
"That is not absolutely impossible," replied the reporter.
"Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?"
"No," answered Pencroft, "for it was still floating. We could not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it would have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks, and it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!"
"That is true," rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.
"And then," continued the sailor, "if the document was several years old, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would have been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was found in a perfect state of preservation."
The sailor's reasoning was very just, and pointed out an incomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been recently written, when the colonists found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave the latitude and longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that its author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be expected of a common sailor.
"There is in this, again, something unaccountable," said the engineer, "but we will not urge our companions to speak. When he likes, my friends, then we shall be ready to hear him!"
During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not once leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing a moment, without taking a minute's rest, but always in a retired place. At meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several times to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables. At nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained under some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion to induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists waited patiently. And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost involuntarily urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped him.
On the 10th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, as night was coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers, who were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he had quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days.
Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person in a fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his fellow-creatures insupportable to him? Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of existence? Was he pining for his former savage life? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself in these incoherent sentences:--
"Why am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?.... Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know who I am--what I have done--why I was there--alone? And who told you that I was not abandoned there--that I was not condemned to die there?.... Do you know my past?.... How do you know that I have not stolen, murdered--that I am not a wretch--an accursed being--only fit to live like a wild beast, far from all--speak--do you know it?"
The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from whom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself. Harding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.
"No! no!" he exclaimed; "one word only--am I free?"
"You are free," answered the engineer.
"Farewell, then!" he cried, and fled like a madman.
Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood--but they returned alone.
"We must let him alone!" said Cyrus Harding.
"He will never come back!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"He will come back," replied the engineer.
Many days passed; but Harding--was it a sort of presentiment? --presentiment in the fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy man would return.
"It is the last revolt of his wild nature," said he, "which remorse has touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify."
In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect Heights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is unnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor Island had been carefully sown. The plateau thus formed one immense kitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of the settlers were never in want of work. There was always something to be done. As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary to enlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace the meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the island, and there was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on short allowance. It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against the depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.
On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How wonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months ago, when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop of six hundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or five hundred millions of grains!
The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and beasts. The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month of November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man. In fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill was necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which flowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first being already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some consultation, it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on Prospect Heights. The building of this presented no more difficulty than the building of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would be no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes.
"Not to mention," said Pencroft, "that the windmill will be more lively and will have a good effect in the landscape!"
They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the mill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily transformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary material.
Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a little to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake. The frame was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it could turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind required it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become very skilful carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models provided by the engineer.
Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a pointed roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the sails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain angle with it, and secured with iron clamps. As to the different parts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two millstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of large square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would allow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to regulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which by the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour, were made without difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not difficult, for in reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This was only a question of time.
Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st of December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his work, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.
"Now for a good wind," said he, "and we shall grind our first harvest splendidly!"
"A good wind, certainly," answered the engineer, "but not too much, Pencroft."
"Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!"
"There is no need for it to go so very fast," replied Cyrus Harding. "It is known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed by a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six times the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate breeze, which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give sixteen turns to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of more."
"Exactly!" cried Herbert, "a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast, which will soon do our business for us."
There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island. On this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next day at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although raised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House. Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood.
In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts? However, Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted in saying that the fugitive would return.
"Yes, he will return!" he repeated with a confidence which his companions could not share. "When this unfortunate man was on Tabor Island, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men are awaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor penitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong to us!"
The event justified Cyrus Harding's predictions. On the 3rd of December, Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the lake. He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for defense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of the island.
Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda, the store of soap being exhausted.
Suddenly cries resounded,--
"Help! help!"
Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not been able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard in all haste, rushed towards the lake.
But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the forest, and bounded up the opposite bank.
Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the one which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was standing with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself together was about to spring.
But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.
The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and activity. He seized the jaguar's throat with one powerful hand, holding it as in a vise, without heeding the beast's claws which tore his flesh, and with the other he plunged his knife into its heart.
The jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to fly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but Herbert, clinging to him, cried,--
"No, no! you shall not go!"
Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him approaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt, but he took no notice of it.
"My friend," said Cyrus Harding, "we have just contracted a debt of gratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!"
"My life!" murmured the stranger. "What is that worth? Less than nothing!"
"You are wounded?"
"It is no matter."
"Will you give me your hand?"
And as Herbert endeavored to. seize the hand which had just saved him, the stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and he appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself, and in an abrupt tone,--
"Who are you?" he asked, "and what do you claim to be to me?"
It was the colonists' history which he thus demanded, and for the first time. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.
In a few words Harding related all that had happened since their departure from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they now had at their disposal.
The stranger listened with extreme attention.
Then the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they had felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the vessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them a new companion.
At these words the stranger's face flushed, his head sunk on his breast, and confusion was depicted on his countenance.
"And now that you know us," added Cyrus Harding, "will you give us your hand?"
"No," replied the, stranger in a hoarse voice; "no! You are honest men! And I--"
是的！这个不幸的人流泪了！他的脑子里准是回想起什么事情，用赛勒斯•史密斯的话来说，这几滴眼泪又使他变成一个人了。
移民们退到不远的地方，让他独自在高地上呆着，使他感到自由；然而他并没有打算利用这种自由，过了一会儿，史密斯就把他带回"花岗石宫"。又过了两天，陌生人似乎逐渐愿意和大家共同生活在一起了。肯定地说，他在听别人说话，而且听得懂，然而奇怪的是，他坚决不和移民们说话，这一点同样可以肯定，因为有一天傍晚，潘克洛夫在他的房门口听见他在自言自语：
"不！在这儿！我！决不！"
水手把这些话告诉了伙伴们。
"这里头准有什么令人心酸的秘密！"史密斯说。
陌生人开始使用工具，在菜园里干活了。他在干活中停顿的时候，总是独自呆在一旁，由于工程师事先嘱咐过，所以大家没有打扰他，显然他是愿意保持孤独的，如果有人走到他的眼前，他就会倒退几步，胸前起伏不停地喘着气，好象挑着重担子似的！
是过分的悔恨使他变成这样的吗？他们只好这样想。有一天，吉丁•史佩莱不由地说：“他所以不说话，恐怕是因为问题太严重了，说不出口的缘故！”
他们必须耐心等待。
又过了几天，那是11月3日，陌生人正在高地上干活，忽然停了下来，手里的铁铲也掉在地上了；史密斯离他不远看着他，只见他又流起泪来。一种遏止不住的同情心使他向这个不幸的人走去，他轻轻地碰了一下陌生人的胳膊。
“朋友！”工程师说。
陌生人想避开他的眼睛，赛勒斯•史密斯去握他的手，他很快地缩回去了。
“朋友，”史密斯坚定他说，“我希望你能看我一眼！”
陌生人看着工程师，好象铁片被磁石吸住似的，在史密斯的力量下屈服了。他想逃跑。可是这时候他的表情突然一变。他的眼睛闪耀着亮光。许多话争着要从他的嘴里迸出来。他再也控制不住自己了！……终于，他叉起两手，用沉重的嗓音向赛勒斯•史密斯问道：
“你们是谁？”
“和你一样，一群遇难的人，”工程师充满感情地说。“我们把你带到这儿来，带到你的同胞中间来了。”
“我的同胞！……我没有！”
“你的周围都是朋友。”
“朋友！……我的朋友！”陌生人双手捂着脸叫道。“不……决不……离开我！离开我！……”
然后他跑到俯临大海的高地边缘去，在那里一动也不动地站了很久。
史密斯回到伙伴们身边去，把刚发生的情况告诉大家。
“是的！这个人一生准有什么秘密，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“看起来好象是个经过忏悔重新做人的人。”
“我们带回来的是个什么样人呢，”水手说。“他有秘密……”
“我们不要问这些秘密，我们要尊重他。”赛勒斯•史密斯很快地打断了他。“即使他犯了什么罪，他也已经用最痛苦的方式赎清了，我们应该把他看作是无罪的。”
陌生人在海岸上独自呆了两个钟头，他一定是在回忆过去整个的一生--这一生无疑是悲惨的--移民们眼睛始终没有离开他，然而也没有打扰他。两个钟头以后，他似乎下定了决心，终于来找赛勒斯•史密斯了。他哭得两眼通红，但是这时候已经不再流泪。他的表情极度谦卑。他显得焦急、腼腆、羞惭，眼睛始终没有离开地面。
“先生，”他对史密斯说，“你和你的伙伴们是英国人吗？”
“不，”工程师答道，“我们是美国人。”
“啊！”陌生人应了一声，接着小心地说，“还好！”
“你呢，朋友？”工程师问道。
“英国人。”他急忙答道。
他仿佛说这几个字很费劲似的，说完以后，就退到海滩上，在瀑布和慈悲河口之间十分不安地走来走去。
走过赫伯特身边的时候，他突然站住脚，压低了嗓子问道：
“几月了？”
“11月。”赫伯特回答说。
“哪一年？”
“1866年。”
“十二年，十二年！”他叫道。
然后他突然离开了赫伯特。
赫伯特把他们的问答告诉了大家。
“这个不幸的人，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“连哪年哪月都不知道了！”
“是的！”赫伯特补充道，“我们在小岛上找到他的时候，他已经在那里呆了十二年了！”
“十二年！”史密斯接着说。“啊！经过一段堕落的生活，再独居十二年，这会严重地摧残一个人的理智的！”
“我这么想，”潘克洛夫说，“这个人不是遇难流落在达抱岛上，而是由于犯了什么罪，被放逐在那儿的。”
“准是象你说的那样，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者说，“如果真是这样，那么把他放在海岛上的人也许有一天会来接他回去的！”
“那时候他们就找不到他了。”赫伯特说。
“可是，”潘克洛夫接着说，“既然他们一定会回来，那么……”
“朋友们，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“在没有进一步了解以前，先不要讨论这个问题吧。我相信，这个不幸的人受尽了苦难，不管他犯了什么错误，他已经用最可怕的方式，赎清了罪恶，由于想摆脱这副重担，他感到郁闷。我们不要逼他把过去的历史告诉我们！毫无疑问，到时候他一定会告诉我们的，等到我们知道以后，我们就可以决定采取什么行动了。再说，只有他能告诉我们他对将来能回祖国是不是还抱着希望和信心，可是对于这一点我表示怀疑！”
“为什么？”通讯记者问道。
“因为，如果他肯定有一天可以被救回去，他就要等待那一天，就不会往海里扔纸条了。那是不会的，比较可能的是，他被判处老死在小岛上，他再也没想到会重新看见同类！”
“可是，”水手说，“有一件事我不明白。”
“什么事？”
“如果这个人流落在达抱岛上已经十二年，那么可以料想得到，当我们看见他的时候，他成为野人已经有好几年了！”
“那也可能。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“照这么说，纸条一定是他多年以前写的了！”
“当然，不过看起来纸条却象是最近才写的！”
“还有，你怎么知道装纸条的瓶子不是经过好几年才从达抱岛漂到林肯岛来的呢？”
“是啊，那并不是完全不可能。”通讯记者说。
“它会不会已经在林肯岛的岸上搁了很久呢？”史密斯说。
“不，”潘克洛夫答道，“因为当我们捡到它的时候，它还在漂。我们决不能认为瓶子在岸上搁了一个时期以后，还会被海水冲走，因为南岸一带到处都是岩石，在那里一定会被撞得粉碎的！”
“不错。”赛勒斯•史密斯若有所思地说。
“还有，”水手接着说，“如果纸条是老早写下的，已经在瓶子里封了好几年，那它一定会受潮的。可是现在完全不是那样，我们发现它保藏得很好。”
水手的论证非常正确，他指出一个不可思议的事实，因为当移民们在瓶子里发现纸条的时候，看起来它还是最近才写的。并且，纸条上还正确地写着达抱岛的经纬度，可见写这张纸条的人和一般的水手不同，具有相当丰富的水文学知识。
“这里面还有没法解释的问题，”工程师说，“可是我们不要急着要我们的伙伴讲话。等他愿意的时候，朋友们，我们再听他说！”
接着一连几天，陌生人一句话也不说，也没有离开高地的周围。他不断地干活，一刻也不停，一分钟也不休息，不过总是在僻静的地方自己干。他从来也不回“花岗石宫”吃饭，虽然一再邀请，他还是不去，只是独自吃一些生蔬菜。晚上，他也不回指定给他的房间，总是呆在丛生的树木下，天气不好的时候，就蜷缩在岩石缝里。他还是和以前在达抱岛的时候一样，住在森林里！移民们费尽了口舌劝他改善生活，他还是不肯，于是大家只好耐心地等待。时机接近成熟了，他受了良心的驱使，几乎是不由自主地作了一次可怕的自白。
那是11月10日，晚上八点钟，天快黑的时候，陌生人突然到居民们的面前来了，当时大家正集聚在平台上。他的眼睛发着异样的光芒，他又完全恢复了堕落时代的野蛮面貌。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们见了他都大吃一惊。在一种可怕的感情支配下，陌生人的牙齿发出一阵阵的响声，好象发高烧的病人似的。他怎么了？他看到同类以后感到难以忍受吗？他不愿意恢复文明的生活方式吗？他还在留恋从前的野蛮生活吗？看样子是的，因为他断断续续地说：
“我为什么要到这儿来？……你们有什么权利硬要我离开我的小岛？……你们认为我和你们能有什么关系吗？……你们知道我是谁，我干过什么，我为什么一个人在那儿？谁告诉你们我不是被遗弃在那儿，而是被判决要老死在那儿的？……你们知道我的过去吗？……你们怎么知道我过去没有偷盗、杀人，怎么知道我不是一个恶棍——一个该死的东西——只配远远地离开人类，象野兽似的生活着呢？说！你们知道吗？”
移民们静静地倾听着，没有打断这个可怜的人的话，这些断断续续的自白，好象是不由自主地从他嘴里迸出来似的。史密斯向他走去，打算安慰他几句，可是他急忙倒退几步。
“不！不！”他叫道，“只问你一句话——我有没有自由？”
“有，”工程师答道。
“那么，再见！”他大喊一声，就象疯子似的跑开了。
纳布、潘克洛夫和赫伯特也跟着往森林的边缘跑去，可是他们空手回来了。
“我们应该让他去！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“他不会回来了！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“他会回来的。”工程师答道。
又过了好几天。可是史密斯总是坚持认为这个不幸的人迟早会回来的。这是不是一种预感呢？
“这是他的野性最后一次发作，”他说，“悔恨的心情触动了它，然而重过孤独的生活，也会压制他的野性的。”
在这一段期间，各种工作都在继续着，畜栏也和眺望岗一样忙碌，因为史密斯想在那里开辟一个农场。不用说，赫伯特从达抱岛上搜集来的种籽已经小心地播种下去了。高地成了一片宽阔的菜园，设计周到，照料仔细，居民们的双手从来也没有闲过。同时工作总是做不完。由于种植的蔬菜愈长愈多，必须扩大园地，这些园地将代替草场，变成一片真正的麦田。好在海岛的其他地方也有大量的野草，不至于饿坏野驴。并且，把深水环抱的眺望岗变成菜园，把牧场迁到山岗以外的地方去，这样要好得多，因为牧场不怕猿猴和野兽侵袭，不需要保护。
11月15日，进行第三次收割了。十八个月以前，他们只种了一粒麦，然而现在麦田变得多么广阔啊！第二次种下去六十万粒，现在收得了四千蒲式耳，也就是有五亿粒麦了!
现在小队里粮食非常充足，每年只要播种十蒲式耳，所得的收成就足够人畜食用了。十一月份的后半个月，收割完毕以后，他们就开始把庄稼变成人的食粮。不错，他们有了小麦，然而这还不是面粉，因此必须有一个磨坊。第一个瀑布已经作为制毡厂的动力来源了，赛勒斯•史密斯打算利用流往慈悲河去的第二个瀑布作为磨坊的动力；经过商量以后，大家决定在眺望岗上建立一个简单的风磨。制造风磨并不比建立磨坊困难，高地面临大海，可以肯定海上经常会有微风吹来。
“不用说，”潘克洛夫说，“风磨比较有意思，还可以便我们周围的景色更加美丽！”
他们开始选择木料，以便制造风磨的骨架和机械。湖的北边有几块大石头，拿来做磨石很容易；至于风翼，那可以用气囊上那些用不完的布料来做。
赛勒斯•史密斯做好模型，磨坊选定在湖岸上，也就是家禽场稍微偏右一些的地方。几根结实的木料支持着一个扇轴，上面安装着风磨的骨架，这样它就可以随着风向带动全部的机械一起转动了。工作进行得很快。纳布和潘克洛夫变成非常熟练的木匠，因为他们只要按照工程师的模型工作就行了。
不久以后，在选定的地点，就树立起一个圆柱形的亭子来，它的样子很象一个胡椒瓶，屋顶尖尖。四根风翼被铁夹子牢牢地固定在中央轴上，和中央轴保持着一定的角度。亭子里的各种机械都毫不困难地制造好了，包括：两块磨石——一块固定的，一块活动的——一只漏斗——这是一只方形的大木槽，上面大，底下小，麦粒从它底下漏到磨石上——一个振荡槽——用来把麦粒慢慢灌入磨眼——以及筛粉机——它可以筛出面粉留下麸皮。他们的工具很趁手，工作又不难——说老实话，磨坊的机械的确是够简单的——问题就在时间了。
全体人员都参加了磨坊的建设工作，12月1日，大功告成了。潘克洛夫和以往一样，对自己的工作感到非常满意，毫无疑问，磨坊的设备是十分完善的。
“现在只等一阵好风，”他说，“我们就可以顺利地磨我们的麦子了！”
“一阵好风，当然，”工程师说，“可是不要刮得太大，潘克洛夫。”
“呸！风愈大我们的风车转得愈快！”
“不必让它转得过快，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“经验告诉我们，当风翼每分钟转动的次数等于风在每秒钟走过的尺数的六倍时，磨坊就能达到最大的工作量。和风每秒钟走二十四英尺，可以便风翼在一分钟内转动十六次，转得再快就没有必要了。”
“好极了！”赫伯特叫道，“东北方恰好有一阵微风吹过来，马上就可以帮助我们完成任务了。”
居民们都急着想尝尝林肯岛的第一块面包，因此没有理由再延迟开工了。这天早上他们磨了两三蒲式耳小麦，第二天早饭的时候，“花岗石宫”的餐桌上就出现了一块呱呱叫的面包，唯一的缺点是还不够松，也许是发得不好。人人都吃得咂咂有声，他们的快乐是不难想象的。
在这期间，陌生人一直没有出现。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特几次到“花岗石宫”附近的森林里去找，都没有找到他，连他的踪迹也没有发现。因为他长时间不回来，他们感到非常不安。当然，在这鸟兽成群的森林里，过去达抱岛上的野蛮人绝不会不知道应该怎样生活；然而，如果他恢复了原来的习惯，如果由于这种无拘无束的生活促使他的野性复发，那怎么办呢？可是史密斯总是一口咬定，这个亡命之徒是会回来的，毫无疑问，这是一种预感。
“是的，他一定会回来！”史密斯信心十足地重复着说，这一点，别的伙伴们却没有同感。“当这个不幸的人在达抱岛上的时候，他知道他是孤零零的一个人！在这里，他知道同伴们都在等着他！他既然已经谈出一部分过去的生活，那么这个忏悔的人一定会回来把全部经过都告诉我们的，到那时候，他就开始属于我们了！”
事实证明赛勒斯•史密斯的预言是正确的。12月3日，赫伯特离开高地，到湖的南岸去钓鱼。他没有带武器，因为直到当时为止，这部分荒岛还没有出现过猛兽，他们从来不作戒备。
这时候，潘克洛夫和纳布正在家禽场里工作，史密斯和通讯记者在“石窟”里制造小苏打，因为以前剩下的小苏打已经用完了。
突然传来一阵喊叫声。
“救命啊！救命啊！”
赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者离得太远，没有听见。潘克洛夫和纳布听见了，急忙离开家禽场，拼命向湖边跑去。
然而，谁也没有想到陌生人却在这里，他在他们的前面跑着，纵身一跳，越过森林和高地之间的甘油河，上了对岸。
赫伯特面前有一只凶猛的美洲豹，样子和上次在爬虫角打死的那只差不多。他猛然吃了一惊，靠在一棵树上，这时候，野兽一蹲身，正要扑过去。
陌生人手里只有一把刀，此外什么武器都没有，然而他却直向猛兽冲过去，野兽看见新的敌人，立刻转身迎上来。
搏斗的时间很短。陌生人十分灵活矫健。他一手有力地掐住美洲豹的喉咙，象用钳子夹住它似的，另一只手攥紧刀子就刺入了野兽的心口，野兽的利爪抓破他的肉他也不管。
美洲豹死了。陌生人一脚踢开它的尸体，正打算溜走，这时候居民们都赶到战场上来；赫伯特缠住他，叫道：
“不，不！你不要走！”
史密斯向他走来，陌生人看见工程师，不禁皱起眉头。他的衬衫撕破了，肩膀上鲜血直往下流，他也不管。
“朋友，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们刚欠下了你一笔人情。你冒着生命的危险，救了我们的孩子！”
“我的生命！”陌生人喃喃地说。“我的生命算得了什么？一个钱也不值！”
“你受伤了吧？”
“不要紧。”
“你能把手伸给我吗？”
赫伯特正打算抓住他那刚刚援救自己的手，陌生人立刻叉起两臂，胸前不住起伏，沉下脸来，看样子他又想逃跑了，经过一番激烈的斗争，他突然问道：
“你们是什么人？说给我听吧！”
他还是第一次要求移民们叙述他们的来历。也许等他们谈过以后，他就要介绍自己的历史了。
史密斯简单地叙述了他们离开里士满以后的全部经过；叙说他们是怎样努力，现在手头有了哪些财富。
陌生人聚精会神地倾听着。
然后工程师向他介绍了大家，吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、纳布，还有他自己，他接着说，自从他们到达林肯岛以来，最大的安慰就是从达抱岛乘船回来的时候，因为他们新添了一位伙伴。
陌生人听了以后，涨红了脸，把头垂在胸前，满脸显得惶惑不安。
“现在你知道我们是什么人了，”赛勒斯•史密斯接着说，“我们能握握手吗？”
“不，”陌生人沙哑地答道，“不！你们是正经人！可是我呢……”
Book 2 Chapter 17
These last words justified the colonists' presentiment. There had been some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which his conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt remorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed the hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men! However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure of Granite House.
What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of it? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret should never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if they suspected nothing.
For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists. The reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard. As to Neb and Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the corral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want of employment.
The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never mingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the society of those who had saved him was insupportable to him!
"But then," observed Pencroft, "why did he entreat the help of his fellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?"
"He will tell us why," invariably replied Cyrus Harding.
"When?"
"Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft."
And, indeed, the day of confession was near.
On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, Harding saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble tone, said to him: "Sir, I have a request to make of you."
"Speak," answered the engineer, "but first let me ask you a question."
At these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of withdrawing. Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of the guilty man, who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate him on his past life.
Harding held him back.
"Comrade," said he, "we are not only your companions but your friends. I wish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you."
The stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a sort of trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to articulate a word.
"Sir," said he at last, "I have come to beg you to grant me a favor."
"What is it?"
"You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to live there with them?"
Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a feeling of deep commiseration; then,--
"My friend," said he, "the corral has only stables hardly fit for animals."
"It will be good enough for me, sir."
"My friend," answered Harding, "we will not constrain you in anything. You wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral we will make the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably established there."
"Never mind that, I shall do very well."
"My friend," answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this cordial appellation, "you must let us judge what it will be best to do in this respect."
"Thank you, sir," replied the stranger as he withdrew.
The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible.
That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary tools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive its tenant. It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from there it was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered more than eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and chest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried to the corral.
The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he had allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied himself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke to his work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready to he sowed when the time came.
It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral were completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and sleep there that very evening.
On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite House. It was then eight o'clock, the hour at which their companion was to leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus imposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be painful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House.
Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light knock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered, and without any preamble,--
"Gentlemen," said he, "before I leave you, it is right that you should know my history. I will tell it you."
These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his companions. The engineer rose.
"We ask you nothing, my friend," said he; "it is your right to be silent."
"It is my duty to speak."
"Sit down, then."
"No, I will stand."
"We are ready to hear you," replied Harding.
The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the shade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it was in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one who obliges himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his auditors did not once interrupt:--
"On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western coast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On board this yacht were Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French geographer, a young girl, and a young boy. These two last were the children of Captain Grant, whose ship, the 'Britannia,' had been lost, crew and cargo, a year before. The 'Duncan' was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men.
"This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of Australia. Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in English, German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked up by the 'Duncan.' This document stated in substance that there still existed three survivors from the wreck of the 'Britannia,' that these survivors were Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found refuge on some land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of which the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer legible.
"This latitude was 37deg 11' south; therefore, the longitude being unknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents and seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain Grant and his two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to undertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to find the captain. He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined him. The 'Duncan' yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which the nobleman's family and the captain's children wished to take part, and the 'Duncan,' leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic, passed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as far as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of the document, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the Indians.
"The 'Duncan' disembarked her passengers on the western coast of Patagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at Cape Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the thirty- seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he re-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through the Ocean.
"After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d'Acunha and Amsterdam, situated in her course, the 'Duncan,' as I have said, arrived at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December, 1854.
"It was Lord Glenarvan's intention to traverse Australia as he had traversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was established a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to the travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause which had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a three-masted English vessel, the 'Britannia,' had been lost less than two years before on the west coast of Australia.
"The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise of the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,--
"'My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is living on the Australian shores.'
"'Who are you?' asked Lord Glenarvan.
"'A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,' replied the man; 'I am one of Captain Grant's crew--one of the castaways of the "Britannia."'
"This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain's mate of the 'Britannia,' as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then believed that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he, Ayrton, was the sole survivor of the 'Britannia.'
"'Only,' he added, 'it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still living, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives, and it is on the other coast that he must be looked for.'
"This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words could not be doubted. The irishman, in whose service he had been for more than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan, therefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice, resolved to cross Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command of Ayrton, while the 'Duncan,' under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan's instructions.
"They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.
"It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the boatswain's mate of the 'Britannia,' but, after some dispute with his captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship, and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the west coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only just.
"Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the 'Britannia'; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan's account. Since his abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of the escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had taken place on the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the 'Duncan,' and make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific."
Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he continued,--
"The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was inevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be called, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of convicts, who had been told what they had to do.
"Meanwhile, the 'Duncan' had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It was necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne and go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize her. After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the midst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which he was charged to carry to the mate of the 'Duncan'--a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days' journey from the place where the expedition had stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter, he arrived at Melbourne.
"So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able to take the 'Duncan' into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become master of the seas. But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects.
"Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom Austin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton's rage and disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking the vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to the east coast of New Zealand. He wished to stop him, but Austin showed him the letter!... And indeed, by a providential error of the French geographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand was mentioned as the place of destination.
"All Ayrton's plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put him in irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing what would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord Glenarvan.
"The 'Duncan' cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March. On that day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the 'Duncan' were being fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.
"This is what had happened.
"After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at Twofold Bay. 'Not "Duncan!"' He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered, '"Duncan" sailed on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.'
"Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate vessel!
"However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous man. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New Zealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his great surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he found the 'Duncan,' under command of the mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!
"This was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the 'Duncan,' but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman, who wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain Grant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at the first port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English authorities. Ayrton remained mute.
"The 'Duncan' continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel. In the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of the ruffian.
"At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities. Lord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about Captain Grant, consented.
"Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew nothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the Australian coast.
"Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The 'Duncan' continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a veritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the thirty- seventh parallel.
"The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and at the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord Glenarvan:--
"'Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible communication with your fellow-creatures. You can-not escape from this islet on which the 'Duncan' leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye of a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither lost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be remembered by men, men will remember you. I know where you are Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will never forget it!
"And the 'Duncan,' making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of March, 1855.
(The events which have just been briefly related are taken from a
work which some of our readers have no doubt read, and which is
entitled, "Captain Grant's children." They will remark on this
occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy in the dates; but
later again, they will understand why the real dates were not at
first given.)
"Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons, tools, or seeds.
"At his, the convict's disposal, was the house built by honest Captain Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed.
"Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very miserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to take him from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them! How he suffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover himself by work! How he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two years, three years, this went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete, suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was this solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!
"But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man, for he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that brutishness was gradually gaining on him!
"He could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at last he became the miserable creature you found!
"I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I, are the same."
Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It is impossible to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and despair lay revealed before them!
"Ayrton," said Harding, rising, "you have been a great criminal, but Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That has been proved by your having been brought again among your fellow-creatures. Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our companion?"
Ayrton drew back.
"Here is my hand!" said the engineer.
Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears fell from his eyes.
"Will you live with us?" asked Cyrus Harding.
"Captain Harding, leave me some time longer," replied Ayrton, "leave me alone in the hut in the corral!"
"As you like, Ayrton," answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:--
"One word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone, why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?"
"A document?" repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant.
"Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the exact position of Tabor Island!"
Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, "I never threw any document into the sea!" he answered.
"Never?" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Never!"
And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.
陌生人说的最后一句话证明移民们的猜测是正确的。他有一段伤心的往事，看起来他象是已经赎清了自己的罪恶，然而他的良心还没有宽恕自己。不管怎么样，这个罪人还是感到惭愧，他忏悔自己的过去，他的新朋友们热诚地想和他握手；而他却觉得不配把自己的手伸给这些忠实的人！不过，经过美洲豹的事件以后，他没有再回森林，从那天起，他连“花岗石宫”的范围以外都没有出。
他的一生究竟有些什么秘密呢？陌生人将来会谈出来吗？这都只好等日后再看了。然而大家都一致同意，决不追问他的秘密，他们要显得毫无疑虑的样子和他生活在一起。
他们的生活和以前一样，继续了好几天。赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱在一起工作，有时候当化学师，有时候做实验家。只有和赫伯特一同去打猎的时候，通讯记者才离开工程师，因为再让少年在森林里单独行动未免太不小心了；他们必须随时当心。纳布和潘克洛夫有时在厩房和家禽场，有时在畜栏，再加上“花岗石宫”里的工作，他们从来也不会没有工作干。
陌生人还是单干，他又恢复了往常的生活，一向不来吃饭，睡觉就在高地的大树底下，绝不和伙伴们发生联系。居民们挽救了他，然而他们的集体生活对他说来，却好象是不能容忍的?
翱墒牵迸丝寺宸蛩担八治裁匆嗣侨ピ人课裁匆涯钦胖教跞釉诤＠锬兀俊?
“他会解释给我们听的。”赛勒斯•史密斯老是这么说。
“什么时候？”
“也许比你想的要早一些，潘克洛夫。”
果然，他自己坦白的日子接近了。
12月10日，也就是他回到“花岗石宫”附近来的一星期以后，史密斯看见陌生人向自己走来，用平静而谦逊的声调说：“先生，我请求您一件事。”
“说吧，”工程师说，“不过首先我要问你一个问题。”
陌生人听了这话，脸立刻涨得通红，打算往后退。赛勒斯•史密斯知道这个罪人脑子里想的是什么，毫无疑问，他怕工程师问他过去的一生。
史密斯拦住了他。
“伙伴，”工程师说，“我们不仅是你的伙伴，而且还是你的朋友。我希望你能相信这一点，现在你有什么话说给我听吧。”
陌生人一手捂着眼睛。他浑身颤抖着，一时说不出话来。
“先生，”他终于开口了，“我请求你答应我一件事。”
“什么事？”
“离这儿四五英里的地方，你们有一个养家畜的畜栏。这些家畜需要有人照料。您能让我住在那儿吗？”
赛勒斯•史密斯非常同情地注视着这个不幸的人，过了一会儿，然后才说：
“朋友，畜栏里的厩房只能勉强住牲口。”
“对我就非常合适了，先生。”
“朋友，”史密斯说，“你做什么事情我们都不限制。你愿意住在畜栏里，那也可以。然而，我们总是随时欢迎你住到‘花岗石宫’里来。可是既然你要住在畜栏里，我们就必须给你整理一下，让你舒舒服服地住在那里。”
“不要管那些，我自己会安排得很好的。”
“朋友，”史密斯说，他总是故意用这个亲密的称呼，“这件事该怎么办才最合适，你应该让我们决定。”
“谢谢您，先生。”陌生人说完以后，就走了。
工程师把他的提议告诉了伙伴们，大家一致同意在畜栏里盖一所木头房子，他们要把它盖得尽量舒适。
当天，移民们就带着必要的工具一齐到畜栏去，不到一个星期，房屋已经落成，只等房客搬进去了。这所房子盖在离兽棚大约二十英尺的地方，在那里照看羊群非常方便，现在畜栏里已经有八十多只羊了。他们还制造了一些家具：一张床、一张桌子、一条板凳、一只碗柜和一只箱子，又拿了一支枪、一些弹药和工具到畜栏里去。
陌生人直到现在还没有看见过自己的新居，他让居民们在那里工作，自己留在高地上，毫无疑问，他想把他的工作全部做完。由于他劳动的结果，整个的地面都已经翻松，只等到时播种了。
12月20日，畜栏里全部收拾好了。工程师告诉陌生人他无论什么时候搬都可以，陌生人答应说当天晚上就到那里去睡。
这天傍晚的时候，移民们集合在“花岗石宫”的餐厅里。这时候是八点钟，他们的伙伴就要和他们分别了。居民们怕由于他们在场，陌生人势必要向大家辞行，这样也许会引起他的难受，于是他们把陌生人单独留下来，都回到“花岗石宫”里面去了。
他们在大厅谈了几分钟，突然听见有人轻轻地敲门。陌生人立刻就进来了；他没有什么开场白，张嘴就说：
“诸位先生，在我离开你们以前，你们应该知道我的历史。我告诉你们吧。”
这几句简单的话使赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们深深感动。
工程师站起身来。
“我们并没有要求你，朋友，”他说；“你有权利保持缄默。”
“我应该谈出来。”
“那么，坐下吧。”
“不，我要站着。”
“你说吧，”史密斯说。
陌生人站在房角落一个光线微弱的地方，他没有戴帽子，两手交叉在胸前，摆好了这种姿势，然后，就好象逼迫着自己似的，开始用一种暗哑的嗓音讲起来，在讲的过程中，他的听众一次也没有打断他。以下就是他的故事：
“1854年12月20日，苏格兰贵族格里那凡爵士的游船邓肯号停泊在澳大利亚西海岸南纬37度的百奴衣角。游船上有格里那凡爵士和他的夫人、一个英国陆军少校、一个法国地理学家、一个女孩子和一个男孩子。这两个孩子是格兰特船长的儿女，一年前格兰特和他的水手们随着不列颠尼亚号一起失踪了。邓肯号的船长是约翰•孟格尔，船上一共有十五个水手。
“游船到澳大利亚海岸来的原因是这样的：六个月以前，邓肯号上的人在爱尔兰海捡到一个瓶子，里面装着一张纸条，纸上写着英文、德文和法文。大意说，不列颠尼亚号遇险以后，还有三个人活下来，那就是格兰特船长和他的个水手，这三个人流落在一个海岛上，纸条上注明着海岛的纬度，然而写着经度的地方却被海水侵蚀了，已经认不出来。
“这个纬度是南纬37度11分，虽然不知道经度，可是只要不管大陆或海洋，一直沿着37度线前进，最后一定能够找到格兰特船长和他的两个伙伴所在的地方的。英国海军部迟迟不去找他们，格里那凡爵士却决定要尽一切力量把船长找回来。玛丽和罗伯尔•格兰特，这两个孩子也和他取得了联系。于是爵士的全家和格兰特船长的儿女准备乘邓肯号汽艇远航。邓肯号离开格拉斯哥，向大西洋进发，经过麦哲伦海峡，进入太平洋，一直来到巴塔戈尼亚；他们原先看了纸条，以为格兰特船长被当地的土人掳去了。
“邓肯号的旅客在巴塔戈尼亚的西岸登陆，然后游船开到东岸的哥连德角去等他们上船。格里那凡爵士沿着37度线横穿巴塔戈尼亚，一路并没有发现船长的踪迹。于是又在11月13日回到船上，以便横渡大西洋，继续寻找。
“邓肯号一路经过透利斯探达昆雅群岛和阿姆斯特丹群岛，但是都没有找到，在1854年12月20日那天，我已经说过，它到达了澳大利亚的百奴衣角。
“格里那凡爵士打算象横穿美洲一样穿过澳洲，于是他登了陆。离海岸几英里的地方，有一个爱尔兰人的农场，农场主人殷勤地招待了旅客。格里那凡爵士向爱尔兰人说明了来意，并且问他，在一年多以前，是不是曾经有一只叫做不列颠尼亚号的三桅船在澳大利亚的西海岸一带沉没。
“爱尔兰人从来也没有听说过沉船的事情；然而，没想到他的仆人中突然有一个人走上前来说：
“‘阁下，谢天谢地！如果格兰特船上还有人活着，那么他一定就在澳大利亚一带。’
“‘你是谁？’格里那凡爵士问道。
“‘和您一样，阁下，也是苏格兰人，’仆人说；‘我是格兰特船长手下的一个水手——不列颠尼亚号船上的遇难人。’
“这个人名叫艾尔通。根据他的证明文件，不错，他是不列颠尼亚号的水手。可是就在触礁的时候，他和格兰特船长拆散了，直到当时，他始终以为船长和所有的水手都死了；自己是不列颠尼亚号唯一侥幸脱脸的人。
“‘不过，’他接着说，‘沉船的地方不是澳大利亚的西岸，而是东岸，如果象纸条上所说的那样，格兰特船长确实还活着，那么他一定已经被当地的土人俘虏了！我们应该到东岸去找他。’
“这个人说话直率，看样子他很有把握：他的话似乎是不会错的。爱尔兰人雇用他一年多了，也证明他忠实可靠。因此，格里那凡爵士相信他是诚实人，就按照他的意见，决定循着37度线，横穿澳大利亚。格里那凡爵士和他的夫人、两个孩子、陆军少校、法国地理学家、孟格尔船长和几个水手组成一个小队，由艾尔通作向导出发了；邓肯号由大副汤姆•奥斯丁率领着，驶往墨尔本去，在那里听候格里那凡爵士的调度。
“他们出发的那天，是1854年12月23日。
“现在应该说明，艾尔通是一个叛徒，不错，他曾经是不列颠尼亚号的水手长，可是由于他和船长发生过争执，就企图煽动水手叛变，把船抢过来，因此在1852年4月8日，格兰特把他丢在澳大利亚的西海岸上，自己开船走了。按照海上的规矩，这样做是正确的。
“因此，这恶棍根本不知道不列颠尼亚号遇险的事情，他仅仅是听格里那凡爵士说过以后才知道的。他自从被抛弃以后，化名彭•觉斯，当了一群逃犯的头子。他所以大着胆子，一口咬定船是在东岸遇的险，目的是要把格里那凡爵士引到那儿去，使他远远地离开他的船，然后抢走邓肯号，用这只游船在太平洋上做海盗。”
陌生人说到这里，停了一会儿。他的嗓音有些颤抖，可是他又继续说下去：
“小队开始作横贯澳大利亚的远征了。让彭•觉斯（也就是艾尔通）作向导，他们是非倒楣不可的。他事先串通好犯人，让犯人有时在前，有时在后。
“这时候，邓肯号已经被打发到墨尔本修理去了。犯人们必须使格里那凡爵士命令游船离开墨尔本到澳大利亚的东岸去，因为在那里劫船非常容易。艾尔通把小队带到离东岸不远的地方，进入一片大森林，爵士在这里进退不得，毫无办法，于是准备给艾尔通一封信，要他送给邓肯号的大副，信上命令游船立刻驶到东岸的吐福湾，因为远征队几天以后就可以走到那里。艾尔通正打算在那里和他的党羽会合。当这封信要交给他的时候，这个叛徒的真面目被揭穿了。他只有逃跑。但是，这封信能使他得到邓肯号，他不惜一切力量要得到它。艾尔通终于得到了这封信。两天以后，就到达了墨尔本。
“直到现在，这个恶棍的阴谋一直进行得很顺利，按他的计划，只要邓肯号开进吐福湾，让罪犯们毫不费力地把船抢过来，把船上的人杀光，然后彭•觉斯就可以在海上称雄了……然而老天爷没有让他实现这些可怕的阴谋。
“艾尔通到达墨尔本以后，把信交给大副汤姆•奥斯丁，大副看了信立刻就启航了。可是第二天艾尔通发现大副没有向澳大利亚东岸的吐福湾出发，却是在向新西兰的东岸航行。你们想，艾尔通该是多么恼恨和失望啊！他想拦住大副，可是奥斯丁把信给他看！……果然，信上写的是新西兰的东岸——原来法国地理学家把目的地写错了，真是万幸。
“艾尔通的全部计划都化为泡影了！他气极了，什么都不顾地蛮干起来。于是他们给他带上手铐脚镣。他就这样被带到新西兰的海岸，他的党羽和格里那凡爵士的下落怎样完全不知道。
“邓肯号在新西兰的海岸一直等到3月3日，那天艾尔通听见炮声。原来是邓肯号开的炮，一会儿，格里那凡爵士和他的伙伴们就到船上来了。
“经过的情形是这样的。
“格里那凡爵士克服了重重的困难和危险，终于走完全程，到了澳大利亚东岸的吐福湾。他打了一个电报，告诉墨尔本‘邓肯号不在此地！’回电是：‘邓肯号于本月18日启航。目的地不详。’
“格里那凡爵士只能断定：他那正当的游船已经落在彭•觉斯手里，沦为海盗船了!
“然而，格里那凡爵士并没有因此放弃寻找格兰特船长的意图。他是一个勇敢而慷慨的人。他搭上一只商船，向新西兰的西岸驶去，然后沿着37度线，横穿新西兰，结果还是没有发现格兰特船长的踪迹。可是出乎他意料之外——可以说是天意安排的，他竟在东岸找到了邓肯号，大副指挥着它，已经在那里等了他五个星期了！
“这一天是1855年3月3日。格里那凡爵士上了邓肯号！艾尔通也在船上。爵士把他喊来，要这个恶棍谈出他所知道的关于格兰特船长的全部情况。艾尔通不肯说。于是格里那凡爵士对他说，在下一次靠岸以后，立刻就要把他交给当地的英国官方。艾尔通还是一言不发。
“邓肯号继续沿着37度线航行。在这期间，格里那凡爵士夫人用说服的方法感化这个恶棍。
“最后她的力量奏效了，艾尔通答应说出他所了解的情况，但是他向格里那凡爵士提出一个交换条件，那就是，宁可把他遗留在太平洋的任何一个岛屿上，也不要把他交给英国官方。格里那凡爵士一心想得到格兰特船长的消息，就答应他了。
“于是艾尔通叙述了自己的一生，当然，从格兰特船长把他留在澳大利亚海岸的那天起，以后的情况他完全不知道。
“不管怎么样，格里那凡爵士还是履行了他的诺言。邓肯号继续航行，不久来到达抱岛。他们打算让艾尔通在这里登岸，也就是在这里——正好是在37度线上——他们找到了格兰特船长和另外两个水手，这真是一个奇迹。
“于是罪犯就到这个荒凉的小岛上去代替这三个人了。当他离开游船的时候，格里那凡爵士说：
‘艾尔通，这里离开任何陆地都很远，不能和人类取得联系。邓肯号把你遗留在这个小岛上，你是没法逃跑的。你将要一个人留在这里，至于你的心眼里在想些什么，上天会知道的。你不会失踪，也不会被人们遗忘，正好象格兰特船长一样。虽然你不值得让人们怀念，然而人们会怀念你的。我知道你在什么地方，知道应该到什么地方来找你。我决不会忘记！’
“邓肯号扬起了帆，很快就不见了。那天是1855年3月18日。
“艾尔通孤零零地住在岛上，可是他并不缺少火药、武器、工具和种籽。
“格兰特船长在岛上盖了一所房屋，可以供罪犯自由使用。他只需要住下来，在寂寞中赎清自己过去的罪行。
“先生们！他后悔，他为自己的罪恶而感到羞耻，他非常痛苦！他对自己说，等到有一夭人们来接他离开小岛的时候，他一定要配得上回到人群里去！这个不幸的人受尽无数的折磨！他辛勤地劳动，想通过劳动，把自己改造成新人！他成天祷告，想通过祷告，悔过自新！两年、三年，时间就这样过去了。艾尔通在孤独之中，变得极其谦恭，他长久地期待着水平线上的来船，问自己赎罪的期限是不是快要到头了，他吃尽了人们所没有尝过的苦难：啊！对于一颗在忏悔中煎熬的心来说，孤独是多么可怕啊！
可是，上天一定以为给这个不幸的人的处分还不够，因为他觉得自己慢慢地变成一个野蛮人了！他感到自己逐渐养成了野性！
“他不知道是不是在独自生活了两三年以后转变的，可是他最后终于变成了你们所找到的那个可怜的家伙！
“我不说你们也知道了，先生，我就是艾尔通——彭•觉斯。”
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们听完以后，站起身来。他们的激动是无法形容的。这是多么悲惨、沉痛和绝望的一幕啊！
“艾尔通，”史密斯站着说，“你过去有很大的罪行，可是上天认为你的罪恶已经赎清了！现在你能回到同伴们中间来，这就是一个证据。艾尔通，你已经得到了宽恕！现在，你愿意做我们的伙伴吗？”
艾尔通后退了几步。
“让我们握握手吧！”工程师说。
艾尔通抓住工程师伸过来的手，他的眼泪止不住流了下来。
“你肯和我们住在一起吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
“史密斯先生，再让我独自呆一个时期，”艾尔通回答说，“让我一个人住在畜栏的房子里吧！”
“随你的便，艾尔通。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。艾尔通正打算退出去，工程师又问了他一个问题：
“再说一句话，朋友。既然你自己愿意过孤独的生活，那你为什么又要把纸条扔在海里，让我们按照地点去找呢？”
“纸条？”艾尔通重复着，他似乎不懂得这是什么意思。
“是的，我们捞到一个瓶子，里面有一张纸条，上面正确地写着达抱岛的位置！”
艾尔通摇了一下头，想了一会，然后说，“我从来也没有把什么纸条扔在海里！”
“从来也没有吗？”潘克洛夫叫道。
“从来也没有！”
艾尔通鞠了一躬，走到门口，和大家分别了。
Book 2 Chapter 18
"Poor man!" said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned, having seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the darkness.
"He will come back," said Cyrus Harding.
"Come, now, captain," exclaimed Pencroft, "what does that mean? What! wasn't it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?"
Certainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!
"It was he," answered Neb, "only the unhappy man was half-mad."
"Yes!" said Herbert, "and he was no longer conscious of what he was doing."
"It can only be explained in that way, my friends," replied Harding quickly, "and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his being left on the island had made it known to him."
"However," observed Pencroft, "if he was not yet a brute when he wrote that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago, how is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?"
"That proves," answered Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton was deprived of intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks."
"Of course it must be so," replied Pencroft, "without that the fact would be unaccountable."
"Unaccountable indeed," answered the engineer, who did not appear desirous to prolong the conversation.
"But has Ayrton told the truth?" asked the sailor.
"Yes," replied the reporter. "The story which he has told is true in every point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result."
"Ayrton has told the truth," added Harding. "Do not doubt it, Pencroft, for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse themselves like that!"
The next day--the 21st of December--the colonists descended to the beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He had reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers judged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time would doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.
Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this day the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at the Chimneys.
"Do you know, my dear Cyrus," said Gideon Spilett, "that the explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write that document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the slightest recollection of it?"
"Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett."
"You think then--"
"I think nothing, I know nothing!" interrupted Cyrus Harding. "I am content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to explain to this day!"
"Indeed, Cyrus," said Spilett, "these things are incredible! Your rescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top's adventure, and lastly this bottle... Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?"
"Yes!" replied the engineer quickly, "yes, even if I have to penetrate into the bowels of this island!"
"Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!"
"Chance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in mysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable which has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the meantime we must work and observe."
The month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer occupations were assiduously continued. During the days which followed, Herbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral, ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which had been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous flock confided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming every two or three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid him a visit.
It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions entertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of the island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that Ayrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to inform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.
Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would be necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer's knowledge. Independently of facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others might happen, which would call for the prompt interference of the colonists,--such as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western coast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.
Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous communication with Granite House.
It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his companions.
"Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?" asked Pencroft. "Do you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?"
"Exactly so," answered the engineer.
"Electric?" cried Herbert.
"Electric," replied Cyrus Harding. "We have all the necessary materials for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch the wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it."
"Well, after that," returned the sailor, "I shall never despair of seeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!"
They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if they failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and other accessories.
The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality, and consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by manufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced with conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring the wire to the wished-for tenacity. This piece of steel, after having been tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid framework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall, the motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact as the fulling- mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved with extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself. It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The iron, prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were sharpened with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of the drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself, to a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size. Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long, which could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance of five miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite House.
It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed as soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery.
It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is known that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of retort coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the engineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able to find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to do without it. Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which is found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has been dehydrogenized, could have been obtained, but it would have been necessary to establish a special apparatus, involving great labor. As to zinc, it may be remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was lined with this metal, which could not be better utilized than for this purpose.
Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a very simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented by Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed. The other substances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal.
The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the results were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each other. A number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid. The engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a glass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged into the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag. Into this tube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash, previously obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants, and in this way the acid and potash could act on each other through the clay.
Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged into azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was immediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the bottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a metallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in the bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore, produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all the phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very simple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would allow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite House and the corral.
On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to the corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to support the wire. A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to produce the electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a second.
Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other for the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to communicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite House should be able to communicate with the corral.
As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two stations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a piece of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The communication was thus established between the two poles; the current, starting from the positive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was temporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative pole. If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became unmagnetized. It was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet, which, attracted during the passage of the current, would fall back when the current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus obtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial, bearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from one station to the other.
All was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day, Harding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if all was going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments a satisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and every morning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which always received an answer.
This mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly, because it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and secondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus Harding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and Ayrton came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a cordial welcome.
The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The resources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded perfectly.
The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The fourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one thought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains duly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea.
The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were, however, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration, swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for some hours.
At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.
The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus, but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate number. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood that their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and Pencroft's time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider under the reporter's instruction, and they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different mineral productions required by the engineer.
Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far West Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything to fear from the heat, for the sun's rays scarcely penetrated through the thick foliage spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the left bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of Falls River.
But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for they met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle. They also, during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars. Gideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil Herbert seconded him well. Armed as they were, they no longer feared to meet one of those beasts. Herbert's courage was superb, and the reporter's sang-froid astonishing. Already twenty magnificent skins ornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and if this continued, the jaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by the hunters.
The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown parts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the vast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup, who accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was anything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at the mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without result.
At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of the most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic apparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any use.
This apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very complete. Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction, collodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it sensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of ammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof, acetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper, nothing was wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared, and before laying in the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was sufficient to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of silver.
The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful operators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the island, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance, the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade and the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the curious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.
Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the inhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.
"It multiplies us," said Pencroft.
And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped as willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the richest shop-windows in Broadway.
But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was incontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not to be described, and his portrait was lifelike!
"He looks as if he was just going to grin!" exclaimed Pencroft.
And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very difficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own countenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of conceit.
The summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes rainy, but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the September of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been hoped. Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter.
It might have been supposed one morning--the 21 st--that the first snow had already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early from one of the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,--
"Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!"
"Snow at this time?" answered the reporter, joining the boy.
Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one thing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was covered with one uniform sheet of white.
"It must be snow!" said Pencroft.
"Or rather it's very like it!" replied Neb.
"But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!" observed Gideon Spilett.
Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for he really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of year and in such a temperature.
"By Jove!" exclaimed Pencroft, "all our plants will be frozen!"
And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble Jup, who slid down to the sand.
But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun was obscured for some minutes.
"Birds!" cried Herbert.
They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage. They had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they had been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded winter at the touch of a fairy's wand. Unfortunately the change had been so sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring down one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species.
A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.
赫伯特跑到门口，只见艾尔通拉动升降梯的绳子，在黑暗中消失了。他回到屋里，叫道：“可怜的人！”
“他会回来的。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫大声说，“这是怎么回事？怎么说，难道瓶子真的不是艾尔通扔在海里的吗？那么是谁扔的呢？”
不错，这的确是一个问题！
“是他扔的，”纳布答道，“不过这个不幸的人已经半疯了。”
“是的！”赫伯特说，“他已经不记得自己干过些什么了。”
“这个问题只好这样解释，朋友们，”史密斯很快地说，“我现在才明白艾尔通怎么会知道达抱岛的正确位置的，原来在他没有被遗留在岛上以前，发生过那样的事情，所以他才知道的。”
“可是，”潘克洛夫说，“如果他在写纸条的时候，还没有变成一个野兽，如果他是七八年前把瓶子扔在海里的，那么纸条怎么没有潮湿呢？”
“这说明艾尔通记错了，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道，“他是后来才丧失理智的。”
“这才对呢，”潘克洛夫说，“要不然就没法解释了。”
“的确，没法解释。”工程师说，他似乎不想继续谈下去。
“可是，艾尔通说的是实话吗？”水手问道。
“是的，”通讯记者回答说。“他的故事完全是真实的。关于格里那凡爵士乘游船远航，以及远航的结果都登在当时的报上了，我记得很清楚。”
“艾尔通说的是实话，”史密斯补充道。“不要怀疑，潘克洛夫，这样会使他痛苦。人在这样谴责自己的时候，总是说实话的！”
第二天，12月21日，移民们下到海滩，爬上高地，发现艾尔通并不在那里。他回到畜栏的时候，已经是深夜了，移民们认为最好还是不要去打扰他。勉励不能做到的事情，时间一定能够做到。
赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布继续做他们的日常工作。史密斯和通讯记者在当天又到“石窟”去进行原来的工作了。
“你知道吗，亲爱的赛勒斯？”吉丁•史佩莱说。“昨天你在瓶子这个问题上所作的解释，完全不能使我满意！你怎么能认为这个不幸的人写了纸条，把瓶子扔在海里，而自己竟一点儿也不记得呢？”
“而且也不能认为是他把瓶子扔在海里的呀，亲爱的史佩莱。”
“那么你想的是……”
“我什么也没有想，什么也不知道！”赛勒斯•史密斯打断了他。“直到现在，还有许多事情我没法解释，我只好把它也算做一桩没法解释的事情！”
“的确，赛勒斯，”史佩莱说，“这些事情真是莫名其妙！你的被救、海滩上搁浅的箱子、托普的冒险，最后还有这个瓶子……这些谜会不会永远得不到答案呢？”
“不会！”工程师很快他说，“决不会，即使需要钻到海岛的地底下去，我也要弄个水落石出！”
“也许有一天，机会能让我们找到打开这个秘密的钥匙！”
“机会！史佩莱！我决不相信机会和神秘。这里发生了许多不可思议的事情，但是总有一个原因，这个原因我一定要找出来。不过在目前，我们还要工作和观察。”
一月份到了。现在进入了1867年。大家辛勤地进行着夏季的工作。接连好几天，赫伯特和史佩莱到畜栏那边去打猎，他们告诉大家，艾尔通已经在专为他准备的房子里住下来。他成天忙着照料托付给他的羊群，这样一来，伙伴们就不需要每隔两三天到畜栏去一次了。然而，为了免得艾尔通长久寂寞起见，居民们还是经常去探望他。
由于工程师和吉丁•史佩莱心里抱着一些疑虑，因此在海岛的这部分地区有一个人管着也是相当重要的，如果发生什么意外，艾尔通也能通知“花岗石官”里的居民。
然而有的事情是必须在发生后立刻就要告诉工程师。除了和林肯岛的秘密有关的问题外，还有其他可能发生的事情，也应该尽快让居民们知道，例如看见来船，西海岸有船遇险，以及可能有海盗到岛上来等等情况。
因此，赛勒斯•史密斯决定要使“花岗石宫”和畜栏能够随时随刻取得联系。
1月10日，他向伙伴们宣布了他的计划。
“怎么，你打算干什么，史密斯先生？”潘克洛夫问道。“你难道想装电报吗？”
“一点儿也不错。”工程师回答说。
“电的吗？”赫伯特叫道。
“电的，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。“制造电池的必要材料我们全都有，最困难的是要有个拉铁丝的工具拉铁丝。可是，我认为这个问题也是能够解决的。”
“好吧，”水手说，“将来有一天大家能坐上火车，我才高兴呢！”
于是他们着手工作，一开始先做最难办的事情，也就是制造铁丝，因为如果铁丝做不成，就省得制造电池和其他的附件了。
前面已经说过，林肯岛的铁质十分优良，因此用来拉铁丝非常适合。史密斯第一步先制造拉模板，这是一种钻有大小不同的圆锥形窟窿的钢板，它可以逐渐使铁丝达到要求的粗细。工程师打算利用瀑布作为动力，就在离开大瀑布只有几英尺的地上，埋了一个结实的架子，把煅成的钢板牢牢地固定在架子上。压榨机就在这里，而且现在正闲着，只要用巨大的力量推动卷轴，它就可以把铁丝拉长并卷上去。这是一项细致的工作，需要十分小心。他们预先把铁做成铁棍，两头锉尖，然后把铁棍插在拉模板最大的窟窿里，卷轴一面卷一面把它拉出来，抽长到二十五英尺到三十英尺，然后再把它松开，依次在较小的窟窿里，重复同样的操作。最后，工程师得到长四十到五十英尺的铁丝，把这些铁丝连接起来，就可以毫不困难地从“花岗石宫”一直架到五英里以外的畜栏去。
赛勒斯•史密斯安装好机械以后，立刻把拉电线的工作交给伙伴们，自己去制造电池；不多几天，拉铁丝的工作就完成了。
现在需要制造一种直流电池。大家知道，现代电池一般都是用炭精棒、锌和铜做成的。工程师一点铜也没有，他找遍了林肯岛也没有找到，只好不用它。炭精就是煤气工厂里使煤去氢以后，在蒸馏器里所得的石墨，是可以做出来的；然而要取得炭精，就必须花很大气力制造一种特殊的设备。至于锌，大家也许还记得，在遗物角拾到的那只箱子里就衬着这种金属，用来做电池再适合也没有了。
赛勒斯•史密斯考虑成熟以后，决定尽量模仿倍柯勒尔在1820年的发明，制造一种非常简单的电池，这种电池只需要锌。其他的东西，硝酸和钾碱，工程师都已经有了。
这种电池利用硝酸和钾碱互相作用而成，它的构造是这样的：工程师用许多玻璃瓶盛上硝酸。瓶上塞着塞子，玻璃管通过塞子，插进瓶里，管子的下端开着小孔，外面由装着粘土的布口袋紧紧地包扎着，管子是打算浸在硝酸里的。工程师预先把各种植物烧成灰烬，做成钾碱溶液，然后把溶液从管子的上端倒进去，这样，硝酸和钾碱就可以通过粘土互相作用了。
然后，赛勒斯•史密斯又用了两块锌片，一片浸在硝酸里，一片浸在钾碱溶液里，两块锌片之间有金属线连接着。一股电流立刻产生了，电流从瓶里的锌片传到管里的锌片。管里的锌片就变成了阳极，瓶里的锌片就成了电池的阴极，把每一个电瓶所产生的电流加在一起，就足够电报使用了。这就是赛勒斯•史密斯的天才的、简单的创造，这个创造可以使“花岗石宫”和畜栏之间建立电报联系。
2月6日，开始在通往畜栏的道路上竖立电线杆，电线杆上并装有拉电线用的玻璃绝缘器。几天以后，电线架好了，随时准备输送每秒钟十万公里的电流，地则作为这种电流的回路。
工程师一共制造了两套电池，一套放在“花岗石宫”，一套放在畜栏；因为这样畜栏有事就可以通知“花岗石宫”，“花岗石宫”有事就可以通知畜栏，这是有很大的好处。
至于收报机和发报机，制造起来非常简单。两地的电线分别绕在磁铁上，这是一块软铁，上面绕着导线。这样，两极之间就可以通电了；电流从阳极出发，通过线路，当它经过磁铁的时候，磁铁就暂时磁化了，然后电流再从地底下回到阴极来。如果电路一旦中断，磁铁马上就会失去磁性。只要把一片软铁放在磁铁前面，电路接通的时候，就会把它吸住，电路中断的时候，它就会掉下来。史密斯把铁片的活动装置做好，余下的工作就简单了，只要在一个圆盘上写明字母，在铁片上安上指针，两个电站之间就可以联系了。
2月12日，一切都已经准备停当。这天史密斯发了一个电报，问畜栏里是不是一切都很好，一会儿工夫，艾尔通就来了一个令人满意的答复。潘克洛夫高兴得发了狂，从此以后，他每天早晨和晚上都打电报给畜栏，每一次都得到了回电。
这种通讯的方法有两个优点：第一，他们可以知道艾尔通是不是在畜栏里，第二，这样艾尔通就不完全是孤单单的一个人了。就是这样，赛勒斯•史密斯还是每星期都去看他，艾尔通也常到“花岗石宫”来，每次来的时候，他都受到热情的招待。
美好的季节在日常工作中度过了。小队的资源，特别是蔬菜和粮食，一天天在增加，从达抱岛带回来的植物长得很好。
眺望岗的高地上也呈现了一片欣欣向荣的气象。第四次麦秋又是丰收，可以想得到，谁也不去计算收下来的麦子够不够四千亿粒了。潘克洛夫虽然曾经有过这个打算，不过赛勒斯•史密斯告诉他；即使每分钟能数三百颗，一个钟头数九千，他也需要差不多五千五百年，才能完成这项工作，善良的水手觉得最好还是放弃这个念头。
天气很好，白天非常热，可是一到傍晚，因为有海风调节大气的温度，“花岗石宫”里的居民就觉得很凉了。在这期间，也曾有过几场暴风雨，虽然历时不长，然而来势非常凶猛，整个林肯岛都被风雨慑服了。电光闪闪，雷声隆隆，往往延续好几个钟头。
在这期间，这小岛非常繁荣。
家禽场里的住宅都挤满了，居民们就以过剩的“人口”作为食粮，可是还应该把“人口”减少到一个适当的数字才行。猪已经生下了猪崽，可以想象，纳布和潘克洛夫为了照料它们，曾花了不少的时间。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特经常骑着野驴——现在它们已经添了一对很漂亮的小驴——出去，在通讯记者的指导下，赫伯特成了优秀的骑手，他们也常用牲口拉车，有时往“花岗石官”里运木柴、煤炭，有时运工程师所需要的各种矿产。
在这期间，他们深入远西森林，进行了几次探险。探险家们到那里去倒用不着担心受暑，因为阳光很难穿透他们头顶上的浓密的枝叶。他们视察了整个慈悲河的左岸，沿岸就是从畜栏通往瀑布河口的道路。
居民们在这几次探险中，总是全副武装，因为他们常常遇到凶猛的野猪，而且和它们搏斗已经不止一次了。在这个季节里，他们也和美洲豹进行过激烈的战斗。吉丁•史佩莱恨透了美洲豹；他的学生赫伯特是他有力的帮手。由于他们经常携带着武器，就不怕遇到这种野兽了。赫伯特是天不怕地不怕，通讯记者则是惊人地沉着。“花岗石宫”的餐厅里，已经挂起二十张斑斓的兽皮了，如果继续下去，猎人们很快就可以达到他们的目的——使岛上的美洲豹绝种。
有时候工程师也参加远征，到海岛上这一带陌生的地方来，他非常仔细地观察这个地带。在这广阔无边的密林深处，他注意的倒不是兽迹，而是一些其他的踪迹，然而他始终没有发现什么值得怀疑的东西。和他一起来的还有托普和杰普，它们都没有表示发现这里有什么奇怪的东西。托普在井口倒是不止一次地咆哮，可是工程师已经到井里去探索过了，并没有结果。
箱子里的照相器材始终没有用过，这期间，吉丁•史佩莱在赫伯特的帮助下，用它在荒岛上风景最好的地方，照了许多相片。
照相机的物镜扩大能力很强，是一架精良的仪器。此外，全部必要的印相器材——涂底板用的柯罗定、使底板能够感光的硝酸银、定影用的亚硫酸钠、涂湿印象纸的氯化迮、浸印象纸用的醋酸钠和氯化金——都不缺少。连印象纸也有，什么都准备好了，在没有把底片放在印象夹里以前，首先要把印象纸放在硝酸银的溶液里浸几分钟。
通讯记者和他的助手不久就成为技术高超的摄影师了，他们拍了许多风景照片，例如在眺望岗上拍的、以富兰克林山为远景的海岛全景，山石巍峨的慈悲河口，背后陪衬着山岭的林间空地和畜栏、爪角和遗物角的奇形怪状的地势等等。
摄影师们也没有忘记给岛上的全体居民照相，他们一个也没有遗漏。
“照相使我们分身了。”潘克洛夫说。
水手的那张相片挂在“花岗石宫”的墙上，照得非常逼真。他站在相片前面，看着自己的样子，高兴得着了迷，就好象到了百老汇大街最豪华的橱窗前面似的，舍不得离开。
然而必须承认，最成功的相片，毫无疑问，还得数杰普那张。它一本正经地坐着，那副样子简直没法形容，照相照得跟活的一般！
“看起来它好象正要扮鬼脸！”潘克洛夫叫道。
如果小杰普还不称心，它就未免太挑剔了；可是它很满意，它那副趾高气扬的样子，多少带几分自负。
随着三月的到来，炎夏终止了。下雨的时候多起来，然而天气还很热。这里的三月相当于北半球的九月，天气并不象理想中的那么好。也许这说明严寒要来得诀些。
21日清晨，人们简直要认为已经看到初雪的景色了。事情是这样的，赫伯特一早从“花岗石宫”的一个窗口望出去，忽然大叫起来：
“瞧啊！小岛上布满雪花了！”
“这时候下雪？”通讯记者一面问，一面向少年走来。
伙伴们跟着都过来了，他们只能肯定一点，那就是：不仅是小岛，而且连“花岗石宫”下面的整个海滩，都是白茫茫的一片。
“一定是雪！”潘克洛夫说。
“真象是雪！”纳布说。
“可是温度表上现在有58度呢（摄氏14度）！”吉丁•史佩莱说。
赛勒斯•史密斯注视着这雪白的一片，一句话也没有说，在这个季度，温度又是这样高，他真不知道应该怎样解释这个现象。
“啊呀！”潘克洛夫叫道；“我们种的东西都要冻死了！”
水手正打算下去，敏捷的杰普已经抢在他的前面，滑到沙滩上去了。
可是，猩猩还没有着地，积雪就往半空中飞起来，只见雪花四处飞散，几分钟内，连阳光也被遮住了。
“鸟！”赫伯特叫道。
原来真是大群的海鸥，它们浑身长着雪白耀眼的羽毛。这些鸟成千上万地栖息在小岛和海岸上，直到它们已经消失在远处的时候，移民们还在目瞪口呆，周围的景象就好象在女巫的魔杖一触之下，忽然从寒冬变成了炎夏。可惜这个变化太突然了，通讯记者和少年都没有来得及打下一只这样的鸟来，因此他们没法知道它们的种类。
几天以后，就是3月26日了，两年以前，遇难的人就是在这一天从高空被抛在林肯岛上的。

Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no communication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news from the civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had been on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!
What was now happening in their country? The picture of their native land was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the time they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still staining with blood! It was a great sorrow to them, and they often talked together of these things, without ever doubting however that the cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American Confederation.
During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island; or, at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln Island was out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,--as was besides proved by the maps,--for though there was no port, vessels might have visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water. But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.
However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed one day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered together in the dining-room of Granite House.
They had been talking of America, of their native country, which they had so little hope of ever seeing again.
"Decidedly we have only one way, said Spilett, "one single way for leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to sail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a boat it is just as easy to build a ship!"
"And in which we might go to the Pomoutous," added Herbert, "just as easily as we went to Tabor Island."
"I do not say no," replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote in maritime questions; "I do not say no, although it is not exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had been caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island, we should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but twelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at least that distance!"
"Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?" asked the reporter.
"I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett," answered the sailor, "and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!"
"Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now," remarked Neb.
"Who is that?" asked Pencroft.
"Ayrton."
"If he will consent to come," said Pencroft.
"Nonsense!" returned the reporter; "do you think that if Lord Glenarvan's yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still living there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?"
"You forget, my friends," then said Cyrus Harding, "that Ayrton was not in possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But that is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among our chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from Tabor Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I believe that he will return."
"Yes," said the reporter, "and I will add that he will return soon, for it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned."
"Well!" answered Pencroft, "I agree with you that the nobleman will return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not at Lincoln Island."
"That is the more certain," replied Herbert, "as Lincoln Island is not even marked on the map."
"Therefore, my friends," said the engineer, "we ought to take the necessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island."
"Certainly," answered the reporter, "and nothing is easier than to place in the hut, which was Captain Grant's and Ayrton's dwelling, a notice which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the position of our island."
"It is a pity," remarked the sailor, "that we forgot to take that precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island."
"And why should we have done it?" asked Herbert. "At that time we did not know Ayrton's history; we did not know that any one was likely to come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season was too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island."
"Yes," replied Harding, "it was too late, and we must put off the voyage until next spring."
"But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that," said Pencroft.
"That is not probable," replied the engineer, "for Lord Glenarvan would not choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is to say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not come till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October days to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there."
"We must allow," said Neb, "that it will be very unfortunate if the 'Duncan' has returned to these parts only a few months ago!"
"I hope that it is not so," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that Heaven has not deprived us of the best chance which remains to us."
"I think," observed the reporter, "that at any rate we shall know what we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht has returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their visit."
"That is evident," answered the engineer. "So then, my friends, since we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently, and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do."
"At any rate," remarked Pencroft, "it is well understood that if we do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable there!"
"No, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "it will be because we are far from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends, his native land!"
Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in the west, was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite House.
However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island. A complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the mouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay between them, which opened like a shark's jaws.
The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his domain.
The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However, during the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a height of twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious for an excursion.
The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the "Bonadventure," anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some duration.
Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the absence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered to keep him company, and made no remonstrance.
On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top, embarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the "Bonadventure" tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety miles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the south coast between the port and the promontory. The wind being right ahead it was necessary to hug the shore.
It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six hours against the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was doubled.
The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue sailing slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to anchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of the coast during the day. It was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night, but would always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor near the shore.
The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen, nothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the sailor, scarcely slept as well on board the "Bonadventure" as they would have done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however. Pencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack they could keep close to the shore.
The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already explored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They coasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything, avoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there. Several times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of the superb scenery.
About noon the "Bonadventure" arrived at the mouth of Falls River. Beyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three miles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western spurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.
What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast! In proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and barren! It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as they are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to indicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet liquid basalt of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses would have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on this part of the island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they overlooked it from too great a height, but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any corner of the globe.
The "Bonadventure" sailed along this coast for the distance of half a mile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes, from twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round like towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical like factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been more capricious in its terrible sublimity! Here, bridges were thrown from one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed. Every caprice of nature, still more varied than those of the imagination, appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length of eight or nine miles.
Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise bordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top, not being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff. The engineer even observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those which the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House.
"Let us go close in," said he.
And the "Bonadventure" sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore. Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there? But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could serve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was washed by the surf. Soon Top's barks ceased, and the vessel continued her course at a few cables-length from the coast.
In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and sandy. A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which the colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other desert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of water-fowl. That evening the "Bonadventure" anchored in a small bay to the north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water there. The night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last light of day, and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.
As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and returned with several strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had done wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and cleverness.
At eight o'clock in the morning the "Bonadventure" set sail, and ran rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and freshening rapidly.
"However," observed Pencroft, "I should not be surprised if a gale came up from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon, and now, this morning, those mares-tails don't forbode anything good."
These mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their height from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like light pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some sudden change in the weather.
"Well," said Harding, "let us carry as much sail as possible, and run for shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the 'Bonadventure' will be safe there."
"Perfectly," replied Pencroft, "and besides, the north coast is merely sand, very uninteresting to look at."
"I shall not be sorry," resumed the engineer, "to pass not only to-night but to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored."
"I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not," answered Pencroft, "for the sky looks very threatening towards the west. Dirty weather is coming on!"
"At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible," observed the reporter.
"A very fine wind," replied the sailor; "but we must tack to enter the gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters."
"Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks," added Herbert, "if we judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf."
"Pencroft," said Cyrus Harding, "do as you think best, we will leave it to you."
"Don't make your mind uneasy, captain," replied the sailor, "I shall not expose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs than a sharp rock into those of my 'Bonadventure!'"
That which Pencroft called ribs was the pan of his vessel under water, and he valued it more than his own skin.
"What o'clock is it?" asked Pencroft.
"Ten o'clock," replied Gideon Spilett.
"And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?"
"About fifteen miles," replied the engineer.
"That's a matter of two hours and a half," said the sailor, "and we shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o'clock. Unluckily, the tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf. I am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind and tide against us."
"And the more so that it is a full moon to-day," remarked Herbert, "and these April tides are very strong."
"Well, Pencroft," asked Harding, "can you not anchor off the Cape?"
"Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!" exclaimed the sailor. "What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a certainty!"
"What will you do then?"
"I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till about seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will try to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the night, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise."
"As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you," answered Harding.
"Ah!" said Pencroft, "if there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it would be much more convenient for sailors."
"Yes," replied Herbert, "and this time we shall have no obliging engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!"
"Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus," said Spilett, "we have never thanked you; but frankly, without that fire we should never have been able--"
"A fire?" asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter's words.
"We mean, captain," answered Pencroft, "that on board the 'Bonadventure' we were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we should have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the precaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October, on Prospect Heights."
"Yes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!" replied the engineer.
"And this time," continued the sailor. "unless the idea occurs to Ayrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!"
"No! No one!" answered Cyrus Harding.
A few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel, with the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,--
"If there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I never lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither on Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!"
两年了！移民们两年来没有和他们的同胞发生过任何联系！他们没有得到过文明世界的消息，他们流落在这荒岛上，就好象是在宇宙里最小的行星上似的！
现在他们的祖国发生了什么事？故乡的情景常常呈现在他们的眼前，当他们离开家乡的时候，国土正由于内战而变得四分五裂，也许，现在南方叛徒还在流着血呢！对居民们说来，这是最痛心的事情，他们常常谈论这些，然而他们一点也不怀疑，北军为美利坚合众国的荣誉而斗争的事业最后一定取得胜利。
两年来，没有一只船曾经开到海岛的视线范围里来过，至少他们从来没有看见过一叶孤帆。显然，林肯岛不在通常的航线以内，而且也没有人知道有这样一个岛——这一点，已经从地图上得到证明了——要不然，虽然这里没有港口，船只也可能来补充谈水。现在一眼望去，周围的海上什么也没有，移民们只好依靠自己，想法子返回故乡。
然而，还有一个得救的机会，在四月的第一周内，移民们有一天在“花岗石宫”的餐厅里讨论起这个机会来了。
他们最初谈到美国，谈到故乡；要想再看到故乡，希望实在是太小了。
“肯定地说，我们只有一个办法，”史佩莱说，“只有这个办法可以离开林肯岛，那就是造一只能够航行几百海里的大船。我觉得既然小船造得成，大船也不会困难的！”
“有了大船，”赫伯特补充道，“我们就可以象到达抱岛去一样，毫不困难地到帕摩图群岛去了。”
“我不反对，”潘克洛夫说，他在航海的问题上总是投赞成的票，“我虽然不反对，可是近处航海和远航却不同！到达抱岛去的时候，不管我们的小船遇到多么大的狂风，我们也都知道，海岛就在附近，可是一千二百海里却是一段相当长的路程，而离我们最近的陆地至少就有这么远！”
“在这种情况下，你不打算冒险吗，潘克洛夫？”通讯记者问道。
“只要你们愿意，我什么风险都敢尝试，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“你们知道，我是天不怕地不怕的！”
“并且，你们不要忘了，现在我们之中又多了一个水手呢。”纳布说。
“谁？”潘克洛夫问道。
“艾尔通。”
“不错。”赫伯特说。
“那要看他肯不肯和我们一起走了，”潘克洛夫说。
“废话！”通讯记者说，“如果他还住在达抱岛，格里那凡爵士的游船到那里去的时候，你想艾尔通会不肯走吗？”
“你们忘记了，朋友们，”这时候赛勒斯•史密斯说，“艾尔通住在那个岛上的时候，最近几年来是没有理智的，可是问题不在那儿。问题在于我们能不能指望苏格兰游船回来，把我们救走。格里那凡爵士曾经答应过艾尔通，等到他认为艾尔通赎清罪恶的时候，他就来接他离开达抱岛，我相信格里那凡爵士会来的。”
“对，”通讯记者说，“我还要补充一句，他很快就会来的，因为艾尔通被放在荒岛上已经十二年了！”
“好吧！”潘克洛夫说，“爵士会回来，而且很快就要来，这我都同意。可是他的船停在哪儿呢？停在达抱岛，而不是林肯岛。”
“这更可以肯定了，”赫伯特说，“地图上根本就没有林肯岛。”
“因此，朋友们，”工程师说，“我们必须在达抱岛上做一些准备，使人们知道艾尔通和我们在林肯岛上。”
“当然，”通讯记者说，“这件事再容易也没有了，只要在格兰特船长和艾尔通住过的那所房子里留一张通知，上面写明林肯岛的位置，格里那凡爵士和他的水手一定会看见的。”
“真可惜，”水手说，“我们第一次到达抱岛去的时候，竟没有想到这样做。”
“当时我们怎会这样做呢？”赫伯特问道。“那时候我们又不知道艾尔通的历史；根本不知道有一天会有人来接他，可惜的是现在真的知道了他的历史，天气却已经太冷，不能到达抱岛去了。”
“是的，”史密斯说，“现在太迟了，我们只好等到明年春天再去。”
“万一苏格兰游船在开春以前来了呢？”潘克洛夫说。“那个可能不大，”工程师答道，“因为格里那凡爵士不会选择冬天到这一带来航海的。不是他已经到达抱岛去过——也就是说，在艾尔通和我们在一起的五个月中去过——现在又离开了那里，就是他还没有来过，要再过一个时期才会来，这样，等到十月天气好转的时候，我们到达抱岛去，留一张通知在那里，还是来得及的。”
“假如邓肯号恰好在几个月以前刚到这儿来过，”纳布说，“那就太可惜了！”
“但愿实不是那样，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“但愿上天不剥夺我们仅仅剩下的这机会。”
“我想，”通讯记者说，“不管怎么样，等我们再到达抱岛去一次，就可以知道有指望没指望了，如果游船已经来过，他们一定会留下一些痕迹的。”
“那是肯定的，”工程师说。“因此，朋友们，既然我们还有一个回国的机会，我们就应该耐心等待，如果这个机会已经错过了，我们也应该等等看，研究怎么做最合适。”
“不管怎么样，”潘克洛夫说，“不管用什么办法，如果我们真的离开了林肯岛，那决不是因为我们嫌在这里不舒服，这一点大家都很清楚！”
“不错，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“而是因为我们不愿远离世界上最亲切的东西：家庭、朋友和故乡！”
商量好以后，他们就不再谈造大船往北到太平洋群岛，或是往西到新西兰去的打算了。大家都忙着做日常的工作，准备在“花岗石官”里度过第三个冬天。
同时大家也一致同意，要在暴风雨来到以前，利用小船作一次环岛的航海。到目前为止，移民们还没有考察过全部沿海地带，他们对于西岸和北岸——从瀑布河口到颚骨角，以及颚骨角之间象张开的鲨鱼嘴似的狭长海湾——的情况，还仅仅是一知半解。
航海的计划是潘克洛夫提出来的，赛勒斯•史密斯完全同意，因为他自己也想看看他的这部分领地。
天气变化不定，可是气压计变动得并不剧烈，因此他们估计天气还不会太坏，然而，在四月份的第一个星期里，气压突然一度降低，等到重新上升的时候，又一连刮了五六天大风；然后指针才保持在二十九又十分之九英寸的高度上，看起来对航海是有利的。
他们决定4月14日动身，乘风破浪号停在气球港，装足了粮食，准备作一次时间相当长的航行。
赛勒斯•史密斯把航海计划告诉了艾尔通，建议他也参加。可是艾尔通愿意留在岛上，于是大家决定，在伙伴们航海期间，艾尔通暂时住到“花岗石宫”里来。杰普奉命留下来陪他，它并没有提出抗议。
4月16日清晨，全体移民——包括托普——都上船了。一阵微风从西南方吹来，乘风破浪号斜兜着风，离开气对港，向爬虫角驶去。岛的周围共长九十英里，从气球港到爬虫角之间的南岸长二十英里。由于刮的是迎头风，因此必须靠近海岸航行。
他们整整花了一天的工夫，才来到爬虫角，因为离开气球港以后，只有两个钟头是退潮，其余六个钟头他们一直和涨潮斗争，逆流航行。绕过海角的时候，天已经黑了。
潘克洛夫向工程师提议，收缩两帆，继续慢慢地前进。可是史密斯主张在离岸几锚链的地方抛锚，以便明天白天视察这部分海岸。同时，大家都希望仔细探索海岸，因此他们一致同意夜间停航，如果天气好的话，尽量保持在靠岸的地方抛锚。
他们就在海角下边过了一夜，风已经停了，周围万籁俱寂。除了水手以外，乘风破浪号上的旅客们几乎都没有象在“花岗石宫”的房间里那样睡得安稳，可是他们毕竟还是睡了。第二天4月17日，天一亮，潘克洛夫就扬起了帆，只要保持着左舷的航向，他们就可以沿着西岸前进。
这一带美丽的森林海岸，移民们是熟悉的，他们曾经徒步到这里来探索过；然而这次它还是引起了他们的赞赏。他们尽量靠岸前进，以便把一切都看清楚，海面上到处漂浮着树干，他们一直在东躲西让。航行中也曾停泊过几次，让吉丁•史佩莱在风景最好的地方拍照。
大约中午的时候，乘风破浪号来到了瀑布河口。在对面的左岸，可以看到一片稀稀落落的树木，三英里以外，连这些树木也比较少了，在西边的山岩间，只有一簇一簇生长的树木，荒芜的山脊倾斜下来，直到海滨一带、
海滨的南部和北部差别多么大啊！相形之下，一边是树木茂盛，土地肥沃，一边是地势崎岖，荒凉贫瘠！人们不妨象某些国家那样，把后面这部分海岸叫做铁滩，它的外表荒芜杂乱，看起来好象是远古时代地质海里涌出来的玄武岩浆突然结晶而成的。如果居民们当初降落在这部分荒岛上，这些大石头一定会使他们大吃一惊！他们在富兰克林山山顶上眺望的时候，因为立足点太高，没有看见这峻峭的海岸；现在从海上可以看得很清楚，它的样子非常冷落，也许世界上再也找不到这样冷落的地方了。
乘风破浪号沿岸航行了半英里。可以看得出来，这部分海滨尽是大小不同的岩石，高度从二十英尺到三百英尺不等，各种样子都有，圆的象塔楼，棱柱形的象教堂的尖顶，角锥形的象方塔，圆锥形的象工厂的烟囱。连北冰洋上的冰山也不会比它们更奇形怪状！有的地方，岩石之间似乎搭着桥梁，有的地方，一连串的拱门就好象波浪似的一眼看不到头；有的地方，巨大的洞窟显得非常雄伟，有的地方是一排排的石柱、尖塔和拱门，可以压倒任何一座“哥特式”的教堂。人们所不能想象的自然界的天工，在这片绵延八九英里的壮丽海滨上，都应有尽有了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们呆呆地看着，惊奇得几乎出了神。他们一句话也没有说，可是托普却没有这种心情，它叫了几声，从玄武岩的峭壁间传来了无数的回音。工程师发现托普叫得有些奇怪，就和它在“花岗石宫”的井口所发出的叫声一样。
“我们向岸边靠近一些吧。”他说。
于是乘风破浪号尽量贴着乱石的海岸前进。也许这里有什么值得探索的洞窟吧？可是史密斯什么也没有看见，这里没有一个洞窟，没有一个缝隙可以供任何一样东西藏身，峭壁的底部经常受着波涛的冲刷。托普不久就停止不叫了，于是他们与海滨保持着几锚链的距离，继续前进。
荒岛的西北部，海岸又变得平坦多沙了。沼泽洼地上，到处生长着树木，移民们也曾经到这里来勘察过，这一带和刚才看到的荒凉海岸完全不同，由于有许多水禽而显得很有生气。当天晚上，乘风破浪号靠近陆地，在荒岛北部的一个小海湾里停了下来，这是附近海水最深的地方。这一夜过得非常平静，随着夕阳西下，海面上变得风平浪静，直致第二天破晓的时候，才重新刮起微风。
由于上岸方便，小队的打猎老手——赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱——就去游逛了两个来钟头，他们带回了好几串野鸭和鹬，托普显示了非常的才能，多亏它热心机灵，打下来的鸟一只也没有遗失。
早上八点钟，乘风破浪号扬起了帆，由于正赶上顺风。而且风势很快就加大起来，它飞快地向北颚角驶去了。
“恐怕要刮猛烈的西风了。”潘克洛夫说。“昨天太阳落山的时候，西边一片通红，今天早上又出现了马尾云，恐怕不是好兆头。”
马尾云是卷云的一种，它们散布在头顶离海面不到五千英尺的高空。看起来好象一片片轻巧的粗棉花，这种云经常预告人们天气要发生突变。
“那么，”史密斯说，“我们把帆尽量都张起来，赶快到鲨鱼湾去躲避吧。我想那里是可以保护乘风破浪号的安全的。”
“完全正确，”潘克洛夫说，“并且北边的海滨，尽是沙子，看起来实在没有意思。”
“就算在鲨鱼湾耽搁今天一晚和明天一整天倒也不要紧，”工程师接着说，“那里是值得仔细搜查一下的。”
“恐怕不是愿意不愿意的问题，而是非那样不可了，”潘克洛夫说，“西边的天色很不好，天气马上就要变了！”
“不管怎么样，他们到颚骨角去，总算是一路顺风。”通讯记者说。
“风倒是好风，”水手说，“但是我们一定要逆风行船才能进港，但愿我能够顺利地通过这一带生疏的海面。”
“根据我们在鲨鱼湾南岸的情况来看，”赫伯特补充道，“这部分海面好象尽是礁石。”
“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“你认为应该怎么办就怎么办吧，我们听你的了。”
“不要担心，史密斯先生，”水手说，“我不会没有办法的！我宁可让刀子刺进我的肋骨，也决不让礁石撞坏乘风破浪号的肋骨！”
潘克洛夫所说的肋骨，就是指船在水里的部分，他把它看得比自己的骨肉还要紧。
“几点钟了？”潘克洛夫问道。
“十点钟。”吉丁•史佩莱回答说。
“离颚骨角还有多远，史密斯先生？”
“大概还有十五英里。”工程师答道。
“那就是说，还要两个半钟头，”水手说，“十二点多钟，我们就可以到达颚骨角的海面上了。倒楣的是，那时候正赶上退潮，海水要往海湾的外面流。再加上有风浪，恐怕很难进去。”
“特别今天又是满月，”赫伯特说，“四月里的潮势是很大的。”
“那么，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯问道，“你不能在颚骨角附近什么地方抛锚吗？”
“快要变天的时候，在靠近陆地的地方抛锚！”水手叫道。“你在想些什么呀，史密斯先生？那非搁浅不可！”
“那么你打算怎么办呢？”
“我要想法子停留在海面上，等候涨潮，也就是说，直到傍晚大约七点钟的时候；如果光线还够亮的话，我就争取进港，要不然，我们就只好整夜在海面上，一会儿靠岸，一会儿离岸，等明天早上太阳出来的时候再进去。”
“我已经说过了，潘克洛夫，你爱怎么办就怎么办。”史密斯说。
“唉！”潘克洛夫说，“如果海滨有一个灯塔，水手们就会感到方便得多了。”
“是的，”赫伯特说，“这一次好心的工程师不能点火引我们入港了！”
“真的，亲爱的赛勒斯，”史佩莱说，“我们一直还没有向你道谢呢，老实说，那次要不是那个火，我们绝不能回到……”
“火？”史密斯听了通讯记者的话以后，非常惊奇地问道。
“我们指的是，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫回答说，“在乘风破浪号回到岛上来以前的几个钟头内，我们非常着急，要不是10月19日那天夜里，你在眺望岗上点起一堆火来，我们就要开到林肯岛的上风头去了。”
“是啊，是啊，亏得我想出这个好主意！”工程师说。
“这一回，”水手接着说，“除非艾尔通想到这一点，要不然就没有人为我们效劳了！”
“不，不会有人了！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
几分钟以后，工程师看看只剩通讯记者和自己在船头，就弯下腰来，低低地对他说：
“我敢肯定，史佩莱，10月19日那天夜里，我绝对没有在眺望岗或是荒岛的其他地方点过火！”
Book 2 Chapter 20
Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in his prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon increased to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from forty to forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea would have run under close-reefed topsails. Now, as it was nearly six o'clock when the "Bonadventure" reached the gulf, and as at that moment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter. They were therefore compelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft could not have gained the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the mainmast by way of a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the vessel towards the land.
Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by the land, did not run very high. They had then little to fear from the waves, which always endanger small craft. The "Bonadventure" would doubtlessly not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous masses of water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers could not sustain them. Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared for anything. Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but nevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety.
During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity for talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter's ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the mysterious influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon Spilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable incident, the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island. The fire had actually been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen it with him! The fire had served to signalize the position of the island during that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the engineer's hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that he had never done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to this incident as soon as the "Bonadventure" returned, and to urge Cyrus Harding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts. Perhaps it would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every part of Lincoln Island.
However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet unknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little vessel stood off during the night.
When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the wind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled Pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease. Towards seven o'clock in the morning, the "Bonadventure," weathering the North Mandible Cape, entered the strait and glided on to the waters, so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava.
"Well," said Pencroft, "this bay would make admirable roads, in which a whole fleet could lie at their ease!"
"What is especially curious," observed Harding, "is that the gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and accumulated by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the stormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as a lake."
"No doubt," returned the sailor, "since the wind has only that narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north cape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance of gusts very difficult. I declare our 'Bonadventure' could stay here from one end of the year to the other, without even dragging at her anchor!"
"It is rather large for her!" observed the reporter.
"Well! Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "I agree that it is too large for the 'Bonadventure,' but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a harbor in the Pacific, I don't think they would ever find a better place than this!"
"We are in the shark's mouth," remarked Nab, alluding to the form of the gulf.
"Right into its mouth, my honest Nab!" replied Herbert, "but you are not afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?"
"No, Mr. Herbert," answered Neb, "and yet this gulf here doesn't please me much! It has a wicked look!"
"Hallo!" cried Pencroft, "here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!"
"But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?" asked the engineer, "for a depth sufficient for the keel of the 'Bonadventure' would not be enough for those of our iron-clads."
"That is easily found out," replied Pencroft.
And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a lead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured nearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding any bottom.
"There," exclaimed Pencroft, "our iron-clads can come here after all! They would not run aground!"
"Indeed," said Gideon Spilett, "this gulf is a regular abyss, but, taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not astonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions."
"One would say too," observed Herbert, "that these cliffs were perfectly perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five or six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom."
"That is all very well," then said the reporter, "but I must point out to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!"
"And what is that, Mr. Spilett?"
"An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of the island. I do not see a spot on which we could land." And, in fact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for landing. They formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more wildness, the fiords of Norway. The "Bonadventure," coasting as close as possible along the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which would allow the passengers to leave the deck.
Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o'clock in the afternoon.
"Ah!" said Nab, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.
One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in those enormous jaws.
The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more than eight miles. The head of the "Bonadventure" was put towards Granite House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the coast.
To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes, among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which seabirds frequented in thousands.
About four o'clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his left, entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five o'clock the anchor of the "Bonadventure" was buried in the sand at the mouth of the Mercy.
The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton was waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them, giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.
A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made, and no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being resided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed their investigations.
Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was agreed that they should direct the attention of their companions to the strange character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island, and of which the last was the most unaccountable.
However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the twentieth time to the reporter,--
"But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?"
"No, Cyrus," answered the reporter, "it was certainly a fire lighted by the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it as I saw it myself, and they will confirm my words."
In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in the evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights, Cyrus Harding began by saying,--
"My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I shall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak, supernatural--"
"Supernatural!" exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from his mouth. "Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?"
"No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly," replied the engineer; "unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed to understand."
"Speak away, captain," answered the sailor.
"Well, have you understood," then said the engineer, "how was it that after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the interior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of my removal there?"
"Unless, being unconscious--" said Pencroft.
"That is not admissible," replied the engineer. "But to continue. Have you understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from the cave in which I was lying?"
"The dog's instinct--" observed Herbert.
"Singular instinct!" returned the reporter, "since notwithstanding the storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived at the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!"
"Let us continue," resumed the engineer. "Have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?"
"No! I confess, not at all," replied Pencroft, "and the wound which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a sharp instrument; that can't be understood, either."
"Let us continue again," said Harding. "Have you understood, my friends, how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace of a wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself so opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having broken its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined us at the very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the ladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how the document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into our hands?"
As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular incidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft stared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of incidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their surprise to the highest degree.
"'Pon my word," said Pencroft at last, "you are right, captain, and it is difficult to explain all these things!"
"Well, my friends," resumed the engineer, "a last fact has just been added to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!"
"What is it, captain?" asked Herbert quickly.
"When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft," continued the engineer, "you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?"
"Certainly," answered the sailor.
"And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?"
"As sure as I see you now."
"You also, Herbert?"
"Why, captain," cried Herbert, "that fire was blazing like a star of the first magnitude!"
"But was it not a star?" urged the engineer.
"No," replied Pencroft, "for the sky was covered with thick clouds, and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr. Spilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words."
"I will add," said the reporter, "that the fire was very bright, and that it shot up like a sheet of lightning."
"Yes, yes! exactly," added Herbert, "and it was certainly placed on the heights of Granite House."
"Well, my friends," replied Cyrus Harding, "during the night of the 19th of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast."
"You did not!" exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment, not being able to finish his sentence.
"We did not leave Granite House," answered Cyrus Harding, "and if a fire appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!"
Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be possible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very irritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time on Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest recesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.
Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite House in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had explored the well, without discovering anything suspicious. The final resolve taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members of the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would thoroughly search the whole of the island.
But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the island which he had made his own personal property belonged to him entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to whom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked of those unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the dominion of some supernatural power.
In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the November of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would be severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season were therefore commenced without delay.
Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter, however hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the musmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool necessary for the manufacture of this warm material.
It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this comfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to spend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be better lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon as the last work at the corral was finished. He did this towards the middle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made himself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took part in the pleasures of his companions.
For the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed in Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many violent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks to their very foundations. Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy swelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges would be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore, which disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat against the beach.
It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill and the poultry-yard particularly suffered. The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs, without which the safety of the birds would have been seriously threatened.
During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana ventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that the most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross the stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage. Plantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly destroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to make use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful distance. Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of Granite House.
They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the frost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by Jup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck, snipe, teal, and others. The access to these hunting-grounds was easy; besides, whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after having passed the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam Point, the hunters were never distant from Granite House more than two or three miles.
Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is to say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was the same with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and sheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the hurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore. The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the activity and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in October he returned to pass a few days in the corral.
During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing strange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the most insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause. Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any signs of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore, as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of them during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly resolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the most difficult to explore. But an event of the highest importance, and of which the consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from their projects Cyrus Harding and his companions.
It was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning. Nature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae which formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves of the banksias, deodars, and other trees.
It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different times, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.
Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o'clock in the afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of reproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape Mandible to Claw Cape.
The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft breeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there under the sun's rays.
The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room at Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay. Herbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained, he went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark nook of Granite House.
Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon. He endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not accomplish it.
"It is a flaw in the glass," he thought.
And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.
But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass almost fell from his hands.
Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he extended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out the little spot.
Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.
The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word only,--
"A vessel!"
And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!
事情正象潘克洛夫意料的那样发生了，他的预言是很少错误的。风愈刮愈大，很快就由微风一变而为正式的暴风了；它的速度达到每小时四十到四十五英里，船如在海里遇到这种风，即使紧收着中桅的帆，也会象飞似的前进的，乘风破浪号在将近六点钟的时候到了港湾口，可是这时候潮势变了，因此它不能入港。于是他们只好与海岸保持一定距离；以当时的情况来说，即使潘克洛夫想到慈悲河口去，也办不到了。他把三角帆升在主桅的顶上，当作暴风帆，使船停下来，船头对着陆地。
风势虽紧，好在有陆地挡着，波涛并不太高，因此，他们就不必顾虑经常威胁小船的海浪了。乘风破浪号的压仓情况良好；所以绝不会翻船；不过，如果有大量的海水打到甲板上来，船骨经受不起，还是可能被打坏的。潘克洛夫是一个经验丰富的水手，他什么都防备到了。当然，他对自己的船很有把握，然而他还是带着几分焦急的心情，等待着天明。
这一夜，赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱没有机会谈话，可是工程师在通讯记者耳边所说的那件事，以及笼罩着林肯岛的神秘力量，却是很值得讨论一下的。吉丁•史佩莱不断考虑这件新的、不可思议的怪事——荒岛的海滨上竟出现了野火。火的的确确是看见了！而且是他和赫伯特、潘克洛夫一起看见的！那堆火在黑夜中标志了林肯岛的方位，他们始终认为火是工程师点的；然而现在赛勒斯•史密斯却一口咬定他绝没有做过这样的事情！史佩莱决定等乘风破浪号回去以后，立刻重新研究，并且主张让赛勒斯•史密斯把这些怪事告诉伙伴们。也许大家会决定共同在林肯岛的所有各处进行一次彻底的搜查。
不管怎么样，这天晚上，在港湾入口处的陌生海岸上并没有出现野火，小船整夜停泊在海面上。
当东方的水平线上曙光初现的时候，风势稍微减弱了一些，改变了两个方位，这就使潘克洛夫进入狭港容易得多了。早上将近七点钟的时候，乘风破浪号向北颚角的上风头开去，穿过海峡，在海面上滑行着，这里四面都是奇形怪状的熔岩峭壁。
“嗯，”潘克洛夫说，“这个海湾是停船的好地方，容纳一整个舰队还能宽绰有余！”
“实在奇怪，”史密斯说，“这个港湾是由两道火山喷发的岩浆凝结成的，一定经过好几次的爆发，才累积成这个样子。结果把港湾四面都挡住了，我相信即使在暴风雨最猛烈的时候，这儿也会和湖里一样平静的。”
“当然，”水手说，“这里只有两个海角夹成的隘路透风，并且北面的海角还遮蔽着南面的海角，风要想刮进来是很难的。我敢说我们的乘风破浪号在这里整整停上一年，它的锚也不会动一动！”
“这个港湾对它说来，嫌太大了！”通讯记者说。
“不错！史佩莱先生，”水手说，“我也认为只停泊乘风破浪号，这个港湾是大了些，可是如果美国舰队想在太平洋里找一个军港，我想再也找不到比这儿更好的地方了！”
“我们在鲨鱼的嘴里呢。”纳布提到港湾的样子说。
“正朝着它嘴里走呢，我的好纳布！”赫伯特说，“你怕它把嘴闭起来，不让我们出去吗？”
“不怕，赫伯特先生，”纳布答道，“可是我不大喜欢这个港湾！它的样子好难看！”
“你们瞧！”潘克洛夫大声说，“我正打算把这个港湾献给美国，纳布却瞧不起它！”
“别的先不谈，这里的水够深吗？”工程师问道，“对乘风破浪号够深，对我们的装甲舰却不一定够。”
“这很容易知道。”潘克洛夫回答说。
于是水手在一根长绳子上绑住一块铁，作为铅垂线，进行测量。这根绳子几乎有五十寻长，然而全放下去以后，还碰不到底。
“瞧！”潘克洛夫叫道，“我们的装甲舰可以来了！它们不至于搁浅！”
“的确，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“这个港湾是个无底洞，要知道海岛既然是火山爆发形成的，那么港里有这样的深渊就不足为奇了。”
“这些峭壁准是笔直的，”赫伯特说，“我相信即使潘克洛夫用一根比刚才那根长五六倍的绳子，也不会碰到峭壁底下的海底的。”
“这都不错，”通讯记者接着说，“可是潘克洛夫，有一点我要告诉你，这个港湾有一个很大的缺点！”
“什么缺点，史佩莱先生？”
“少一个通到荒岛内陆去的豁口，或是通路。我找不到一个可以登陆的地方。”
不错，熔岩所形成的峭壁上没有一处适合登岸的地方。峭壁形成一道不能超越的障碍，看见它就会使人联想起挪威的峡湾，只是这里显得更荒凉更冷落罢了。乘风破浪号尽量贴近断岩前进，但是连一块可以供旅客们登岸的堤埂也没有发现。
潘克洛夫只好安慰自己说，必要的时候，只需一个地雷，很快就可以在峭壁上炸出一个缺口来；他们在港湾里呆着，显然没有任何事情可做，于是水手就把船头调向海峡，下午两点钟左右，他们穿出了港湾。
“唉！”纳布这才轻松地舒了一口气。
忠实的黑人在那张大嘴里，的确感到很不舒服。
颚骨角离慈悲河口不到八英里。乘风破浪号船头对着“花岗石宫”，一阵微风鼓起船帆，它在离岸一海里的海面上飞快地向前驶去了。
巨大的熔岩峭壁过去以后，不久就到了形状奇特的沙丘地带，工程师就是在这里莫名其妙地得救的；这一带常常有成万的海鸥飞来。
大约四点钟，潘克洛夫驾船从小岛的地岬向右驶去，进入了小岛和海岸之间的海峡，五点钟的时候，乘风破浪号在慈悲河口的沙滩上抛锚了。
移民们和他们的住宅阔别了三天。艾尔通在海滩上等待着他们，杰普也兴高采烈地跟来迎接了，它低声叫着，表示高兴。
现在，荒岛的沿岸已经全部搜索过了，然而并没有发现任何可疑的地方。如果有什么神秘的东西住在荒岛上，他只可能隐藏在盘蛇半岛的不可穿透的森林底下，因为只有那里移民们还没有去搜查过。
吉丁•史佩莱和工程师讨论了这些情况以后，他们决定让伙伴们注意岛上发生过的怪事，在所有这些怪事之中，最近发生的一件最令人感到无法理解。
可是，谈到海岸上有外人点火的问题，史密斯止不住又要问——差不多已经问了二十遍了——通讯记者：
“你肯定看到火了吗，是不是火山的局部爆发，或者是什么流星呢？”
“不是的，赛勒斯，”通讯记者答道；“千真万确是人点的火。不信你可以问潘克洛夫和赫伯特。他们和我同样看见的，他们可以证明我的话。”
因此，又过了几天，4月25日晚上，当居民们都聚在眺望岗上的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯开始向大家说：
“朋友们，我觉得我有责任提请你们注意岛上所发生的一些事情，希望大家能对这个问题提出自己的看法。这些事情，说起来是神奇的……”
“神奇！”水手喷了一口烟，叫道。“我们的岛上真能有神奇的事情吗？”
“不，潘克洛夫，不过可以肯定地说，是神秘的，”工程师答道；“除非你能解答史佩莱和我到现在还弄不明白的问题。”
“你说吧，史密斯先生。”水手说。
“好吧，”于是工程师说，“你明白不明白，我掉在海里以后，怎么会到四分之一英里以外的内陆来的，同时自己竟一点儿也不知道？”
“也许是当时失去了知觉……”潘克洛夫说。
“这是讲不通的，”工程师说。“还有，你们当时住的‘石窟’离我躺的山洞有五英里远，托普怎么能找到那里去的，你知道吗？”
“狗的直觉……”赫伯特说。
“这种直觉也太奇怪了！”通讯记者说；“再说，当天夜里狂风暴雨一直也没有停，可是托普到‘石窟’的时候，身上却很干，并且一点泥也没有！”
“我们接着谈，”工程师又说。“托普在湖里和儒艮进行了一场搏斗以后，怎么会莫名其妙地被抛到水面上来的，你们明白吗？”
“不明白！我承认，一点也不明白，”潘克洛夫答道；“还有儒艮侧面受的伤，那好象是被什么利器割伤的，这件事我也不明白。”
“还有，”史密斯说。“小西瑞身上怎么会有一颗枪弹的；没有遇难船只的遗迹，怎么会有一只箱子好好地搁在海滩上的；装着纸条的瓶子怎么偏偏在我们试航的时候出现；正在我们需要船只的时候，为什么我们的平底船那么巧断了绳子，又那么巧从慈悲河上漂到我们身边来；在猿猴侵袭我们以后，软梯怎么会那么巧地从‘花岗石宫’上面落下来；最后，艾尔通一口咬定他从来也没有写过的纸条，怎么会跑到我们手里来的；这些问题你们都明白吗？”
当赛勒斯•史密斯在一件一件地列举着荒岛上发生过的这些怪事时，赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫都你瞧着我，我瞧着你，不知道应该怎样回答，这一系列的事情，今天是头一次被归纳在一起，他们听了以后，不由地感到十分惊讶。
“不错，”潘克洛夫到底承认了，“你说得对，史密斯先生，所有这些事情都很难解释！”
“还有，朋友们，”工程师接着说，“最近又添了一件事情，比起以前那些事情来，恐怕更要离奇！”
“什么事，史密斯先生？”赫伯特马上问道?
芭丝寺宸颍惫こ淌幼潘担澳阍倒蹦忝谴哟锉У夯乩吹氖焙颍挚系荷铣鱿止艋穑锹穑俊?
“当然。”水手答道。
“你能肯定你确实看见这堆火了吗？”
“当然能肯定，那天看见火光，就好象我现在看见你那样千真万确。”
“你也看见了吗，赫伯特？”
“怎么，史密斯先生，”赫伯特叫道，“那堆火象一等星那么亮呢！”
“可是那是不是一颗星呢？”工程师追问道。
“不是，”潘克洛夫回答说，“当时天上布满了乌云，并且，不论怎么说，星星也不会低到水平线上来呀。史佩莱先生和我们同样看见的，他可以证实我们的话。”
“我再补充一句，”通讯记者说，“就是火光非常亮，象一片闪电似的。”
“是的，是的！一点也不错，”赫伯特附和着说，“看起来一定是点在‘花岗石宫’的高岗上的。”
“好吧，朋友们，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“10月19日那天夜里，纳布和我都没有在海滨上点过火。”
“你没有点过火？”潘克洛夫这一下吃惊不小，连话也说不下去了。
“我们没有离开‘花岗石宫’，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“如果看见海滨上有火，那准是别人点的！”
潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布都楞住了。这决不是看花了眼；他们的确在10月19日夜里看见过一堆篝火。
是的，他们不得不承认，这里存在着秘密！每当林肯岛遇到紧要关头的时候，就有一种不可思议的力量在起作用，这种力量肯定是在帮助移民们，然而却激起了他们的好奇心。会不会有什么东西藏在最隐蔽的地方呢？必须不惜任何代价证实这一点。
史密斯还向伙伴们提起一件事，托普和杰普有时奇怪地在沟通“花岗石宫”和大海的井口旁边来回乱走，工程师告诉大家，他曾经探索过井底，可是没有发现任何可疑的东西。经过这一次谈话，小队全体决定，等到季节转暖以后，他们就立刻搜查一下整个的荒岛。
可是，从这一天起，潘克洛夫就显得坐立不安起来了。他曾经认为荒岛是自己的私有财产，现在他却觉得似乎这份财产已经不完全属于自己，而是和另外一个主人共有的了，而且不管水手愿不愿意，他息觉得自己在受这个人的支配。纳布和他常常谈起这些无法解释的事情，由于他们一向疑神疑鬼，他们简直就要认为有什么超凡的力量在暗中统治着林肯岛了。
从五月份起——也就是北半球的十一月——天气转坏了。看起来今年的冬季一定冷，而且来得要早些。于是他们立刻开始准备过冬。
虽然冬天将要相当冷，可是移民们已经准备得很好了。这时候摩弗仑羊的数目已经很多，供应着大量制造毡子所必需的羊毛，他们做成了许多这种温暖织料的衣服。
不用说，他们也给艾尔通准备了一套这种舒适的衣服。赛勒斯•史密斯向他建议到“花岗石宫”来和他们一起过冬，因为在这里居住要比畜栏舒服；艾尔通答应等畜栏里的工作完毕以后立刻就来。四月中旬，他搬过来了。从此，艾尔通和大家共同过着集体的生活，在任何场合，他都尽到自己的力量，然而他还是那样谦恭而忧郁，不能和伙伴们在一起有说有笑。
居民们在林肯岛上的第三个冬天，大部分是在“花岗石宫”里度过的。有好几次狂风暴雨，好象把他们的基石都震动了。滔天的巨浪仿佛要漫过整个的海岛，不管什么样的船只，只要停泊在岸边；一定会被撞得粉碎。在某一次风暴里，慈悲河泛滥起来的洪水，有两次几乎把桥梁都要冲走了，每当怒潮冲击海滩的时候，扬起一片水花，堤岸被掩盖得看不见了，因此必须加固岸上的桥身。
这种暴风雨和夹着雨雪的龙卷风差不多，眺望岗的高地上被风暴酿成极大的灾害，这是可以想象的。磨坊和家禽场的损失尤其重大。移民们往往不得不马上把它修理好，要不然家禽的安全就会受到严重的威胁。
在天气最坏的时候，曾经有几只美洲豹和成群的猿猴闯到高地的边缘来，这些灵活和胆大的野兽，被饥饿所迫，是可能跳过河来的，特别是在河水结冰的时候，要过来很容易；这一点很使居民们担心。如果没有人经常守望，它们一旦过来以后，农作物和家畜就难免要遭殃了，因此往往要用枪来接待这些危险的客人，不让它们走近。这一冬移民们并不缺少活计干，除了户外的不算，他们总有上千条的计划，来装备他们的“花岗石宫”。
遇到下霜的日子，他们也曾经到宽广的潦凫沼地去打过几次猎。这里有无数的野鸭、鹬、短颈野鸭和其他的水禽，吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特在杰普和托普的配合下，向来是百发百中。猎人们到这一带猎场去比较方便；不管跨过慈悲河桥，从通向气球港的大路去也好，还是从遗物角绕过峭壁去也好，离“花岗石宫”都不过只有二三英里。
冬季的四个月——六月、七月、八月和九月，就这样度过了，在这期间天气的确是够冷的。可是，总的来说，“花岗石宫”并没有受到风暴多大威胁，畜栏也是一样，由于它不象高地那样暴露在外面，有富兰克林山遮挡着一部分，前面又有森林和海岸的峭壁，因此袭击过来的风暴已经很微弱了。那里的损失很小，十月间艾尔通回到畜栏里去暂住了几天，他动作快，手艺好，不多久就把损坏的地方全修理好了。
在这个冬天，没有发生什么新鲜的怪事。虽然潘克洛夫和纳布哪怕是遇到最不值得一提的小事，也要联想一下是不是有神秘的来源，然而还是没有什么怪事发生。托普和杰普不再逗留在井边了，也不显得有什么不安。看起来这一系列的怪事似乎中断了，不过晚上他们还是常常在“花岗石宫”里谈起这些事情，而且他们要彻底搜查一下荒岛的决定并没有改变，连最难探索的地方也不想放过。就在这时候，一件十分重要的事情使得赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴暂时改变他们的计划，这件事情，也许会产生非常可怕的后果的。
这时候是十月。转眼之间，就要大地回春了。大自然在苏醒，森林的边缘是松柏科的常绿树，其中的山茂、喜马拉雅杉和一些别的树，已经长出了嫩叶。
大家也许还记得，吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特在林肯岛上拍摄风景照片已经不止一次了。
10月17日下午，将近三点钟的时候，晴朗的天气引诱着赫伯特，他想拍一张联合湾的风景照片，联合湾就在眺望岗的对面，它一头是颚骨角，一头是爪角。
水平线上清晰动人，大海和湖面一样平静，只是在和风的吹拂下，微微激起涟漪，阳光闪耀着，到处反射出片片银光。
照相机依托在“花岗石宫”里餐厅的一个窗口上，俯瞰着海岸和整个的港湾。赫伯特按照通常的方法拍下这个镜头，底片感光以后，他就到一个阴暗的角落里用药品去定影了。
然后他又回到亮处来，仔细观看，赫伯特发现底片的海平线上有一个看不清楚的小黑点。他反复洗几次，打算把它去掉，可是洗不掉。
“这是镜头上的斑点。”他这样想。
可是由于好奇心的驱使，他从望远镜上拧下一个倍数很大的放大镜来，打算仔细看一下这个斑点。
他刚刚看下去，马上就大喊一声，放大镜几乎从手里掉下来。
他立刻跑到赛勒斯•史密斯那里，把底片和放大镜递给工程师，指着底片上的小黑点。
史密斯细看了一下，然后抓起望远镜就冲到窗口。
望远镜慢慢地扫过水平线，最后停在所要找的那一点上，赛勒斯•史密斯放下望远镜，只说了一句：
“一只船！”
果然，在离开林肯岛不远的地方，有一只船停在那里！
Book 3 Chapter 1
It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no communication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter had attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to a bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that was a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton, alone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to join the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October, other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that deserted sea!
There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she pass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would definitely know what to expect.
Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them what had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the horizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative,--
"I'm blessed but it is really a vessel!" he exclaimed, in a voice which did not express any great amount of satisfaction.
"Is she coming here?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Impossible to say anything yet," answered Pencroft, "for her rigging alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen."
"What is to be done?" asked the lad.
"Wait," replied Harding.
And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to all the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which were aroused by this incident--the most important which had occurred since their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not in the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly contending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and incessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries. Pencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and so rich, would not have left their island without regret. They were accustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship brought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land. It was bringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply their hearts were moved at the sight!
From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the window. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was at a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet, therefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have been visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by Mount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel's lookout. But why was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Island, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made by Herbert.
"Can it be the 'Duncan'?" he cried.
The "Duncan," as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan's yacht, which had left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch him. Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but that a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in latitude.
"We must tell Ayrton," said Gideon Spilett, "and send for him immediately. He alone can say if it is the 'Duncan.'"
This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House, sent this telegram:--"Come with all possible speed."
In a few minutes the bell sounded.
"I am coming," replied Ayrton.
Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.
"If it is the 'Duncan,'" said Herbert, "Ayrton will recognize her without difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time."
"And if he recognizes her," added Pencroft, "it will agitate him exceedingly!"
"Yes," answered Cyrus Harding; "but now Ayrton is worthy to return on board the 'Duncan,' and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan's yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are ill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to our island."
"We could defend it,', cried Herbert.
"No doubt, my boy," answered the engineer smiling, "but it would be better not to have to defend it."
"A useless observation," said Spilett. "Lincoln Island is unknown to navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do you think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding herself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than avoid it?"
"Certainly," replied Pencroft.
"I think so too," added the engineer. "It may even be said that it is the duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet known, and Lincoln Island is in this position."
"Well," said Pencroft, "suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a few cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?"
This sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus Harding, after some moments' thought, replied in the calm tone which was usual to him,--
"What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:--we will communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we will leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name of the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic with a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!"
"Hurrah!" exclaimed Pencroft, "and that will be no small present which we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost finished; names are given to every part of the island; there is a natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and manufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe Lincoln Island on the maps!"
"But if anyone seizes it in our absence?" observed Gideon Spilett.
"Hang it!" cried the sailor. "I would rather remain all alone to guard it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn't steal it from him, like a watch from the pocket of a swell!"
For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was nearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not determine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the wind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea being calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows were not marked on the chart.
Towards four o'clock--an hour after he had been sent for--Ayrton arrived at Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,--
"At your service, gentlemen."
Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading him to the window,--
"Ayrton," said he, "we have begged you to come here for an important reason. A ship is in sight of the island."
Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim; then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see nothing.
"Take this telescope," said Spilett, "and look carefully, Ayrton, for it is possible that this ship may be the 'Duncan' come to these seas for the purpose of taking you home again."
"The 'Duncan!'" murmured Ayrton. "Already?" This last word escaped Ayrton's lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.
Did not twelve years' solitude on a desert island appear to him a sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?
"No," said he, "no! it cannot be the 'Duncan'!"
"Look, Ayrton," then said the engineer, "for it is necessary that we should know beforehand what to expect."
Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a word. Then,--
"It is indeed a vessel," said he, "but I do not think she is the 'Duncan.'"
"Why do you not think so?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Because the 'Duncan' is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel."
"Perhaps she is simply sailing," observed Pencroft. "The wind is favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land."
"It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft," answered Ayrton, "and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect."
So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent. The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no part in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it impossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were particularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one place. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual calm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the engineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared rather than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore, reasonable to believe that the engineer's apprehensions would not be justified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger.
Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and top- gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind was from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon--a provoking circumstance, for it was already five o'clock in the evening, and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.
"What shall we do when night comes on?" asked Gideon Spilett. "Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?"
This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still retained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative. During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this ship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island? Who could foresee what the future would then have in store for the colonists?
"Yes," said the reporter, "we ought to make known to that vessel, whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the opportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting regrets."
It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port Balloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense fire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig.
But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave Granite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood directly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached rapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the glass was put into Ayrton's hands, that he might ascertain for certain whether the ship was or was not the "Duncan." The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only five miles.
The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton soon let the glass fall again, saying--
"It is not the 'Duncan'! It could not be!"
Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to say.
"And yet," added the sailor, "a flag is floating from her peak, but I cannot distinguish the colors of it."
"In half an hour we shall be certain about that," answered the reporter. "Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the latest, we shall make his acquaintance."
"Never mind!" said Pencroft. "It is best to know whom we have to deal with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow's colors!"
And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig's ensign hung in folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.
"It is not the American flag," said Pencroft from time to time, "nor the English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would say it was all one color. Let's see: in these seas, what do we generally meet with? The Chilean flag?--but that is tri-color. Brazilian?--it is green. Japanese?--it is yellow and black, while this--"
At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a hoarse voice,--
"The black flag!" he exclaimed.
And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig, and they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious vessel!
Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a pirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas which still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of Lincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a sheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers' honest domain destined to be transformed into an infamous refuge--the headquarters of the piracy of the Pacific?
All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists' imaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which must be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of pirates! It was that which the "Duncan" would have carried, had the convicts succeeded in their criminal design! No time was lost before discussing it.
"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, "perhaps this vessel only wishes to survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is a chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to hide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily seen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also conceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires must be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the island."
"And our vessel?" said Herbert.
"Oh," answered Pencroft, "she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy any of those rascals there to find her!"
The engineer's orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton ascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal any indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their companions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff. At the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be at hand in case of an unexpected attack.
When all these precautions had been taken,--
"My friends," said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, "if the wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it--shall we not?"
"Yes, Cyrus," replied the reporter, "and if necessary we will die to defend it!"
The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly. Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he, the former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!
Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton's mind, and going to him--
"And you, Ayrton," he asked, "what will you do?"
"My duty," answered Ayrton.
He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage.
It was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming obscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union Bay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the plateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter.
Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first question. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the second. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and stand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in an hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.
Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag without deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these pirates--for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else--already visited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their colors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as yet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?
To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but be seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.
However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates were numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this information to he obtained?
Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped the island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles of clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on the shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her whereabouts could not be discovered.
"Well! who knows?" said Pencroft. "Perhaps that cursed craft will stand off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak."
As if in reply to the sailor's observation, a bright light flashed in the darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.
The vessel was still there and had guns on board.
Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.
Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.
At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the hawse-holes.
The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!
这群遇难的人从气球上掉到林肯岛上来已经有两年半了，在这期间，他们和外界始终没有联系。有一次，通讯记者曾经把他们所在的地点写在一封信里，让一只鸟把信带到大陆上去，但这仅仅是个机会，不能对它抱很大的希望。艾尔通是唯一参加到小队里来的人，当时的情况已经叙述过了。在10月17日那天，在这荒凉的海岛上，忽然出乎意料地望见了另外一些人。
这是铁一般的事实！那边有一只船！它是路过这里，还是要来靠岸呢？究竟是什么情况，几个钟头以后，居民们就可以知道了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特立刻把吉丁•史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布喊到“花岗石宫”的餐厅里来，告诉他们发生了什么事。潘克洛夫拿起望远镜，很快地在水平线上扫视了一下，然后停在他们所指的一点上，也就是照相底片上模糊不清的那一点。
“谢天谢地！真是一只船！”他喊道，但是他并没有带着十分满意的口气。
“它是向这儿开吗？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“现在还很难说，”潘克洛夫回答说，“因为只有桅杆露在水平线上，船身还一点看不见呢。”
“该怎么办呢？”少年问道。
“等着吧。”史密斯回答说。
居民们沉默了很久，这是他们来到林肯岛以后遇到的最重要的一次事件。他们沉浸在这件事情所引起的一切思想、感情、恐惧和希望里。当然，居民们所处的环境和一般流落在荒芜小岛上的难民还不一样，那些人经常要为艰苦的生存和残酷的自然进行斗争，并时常会由于思乡而感到苦闷。可是在这里，特别是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们感到既愉快，又富裕；因此，假如有一天真的要离开这个荒岛，他们甚至会感到遗憾的。居民们依靠他们的智慧，把这片土地开发了。他们已经过惯了这里的新生活。但是这只船无论如何是从大陆、甚至可能是从他们的家乡带来消息的。它将要给他们带来同伴；因此，在看见船的时候，他们内心的激动是可以想象的！
潘克洛夫靠在窗口，不时拿起望远镜。从这时候起，他一直注视着那只船。它的位置在东面二十海里的海面上。由于距离相当远，移民们还没有办法发信号。信号旗是没法看见的，枪声也不可能听见，甚至点起烽火来，船上也不会看到。但是有一点是可以肯定的，那就是：这个高耸着富兰克林山的海岛绝对逃不了船上守望者的视线。可是这只船到这儿来干什么呢？纯粹是偶然来到这里的吗？太平洋的这个区域在地图上除了达抱岛以外，并没有其他的陆地，而达抱岛本身又不在从波里尼西亚群岛、新西兰和美国海岸启航的船只经常跑过的航线以内。这个问题人人都在考虑，赫伯特突然作了回答。
“这会不会是邓肯号呢？”他大声说。
前面已经说过，邓肯号是格里那凡爵士的游船，它曾经把艾尔通遗弃在小岛上，日后还要来把他接回去。达抱岛离林肯岛并不太远，经线距离只有一百五十英里，纬线距离只有七十五英里，在林肯岛上还可以望见向那个岛驶去的船只。
“我们一定要告诉艾尔通，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“立刻把他喊来。只有他能告诉我们这只船是不是邓肯号。”
大家都表示同意，于是通讯记者就跑到联系畜栏和“花岗石宫”的电报机旁，发了—个电报：“速来。”
几分钟后，铃响了。
艾尔通的回电是：“即来。”
于是居民们继续守望着船只。
“假如是邓肯号，”赫伯特说，“艾尔通是能毫不困难地认出来的，因为他在那只船上呆过一个时期。”
“假如艾尔通认出了它，”潘克洛夫接着说，“他一定会非常激动的！”
“是的，”赛勒斯•史密斯说：“但愿这真是格里那凡爵士的游船，艾尔通现在已经够得上回邓肯号去了。不过我担心可能是别的船。这一带海面是歹人出没的地方，我总怕海盗会到我们的岛上来。”
“我们可以防御。”赫伯特叫道。
“那当然，孩子，”工程师含笑说，“要是能不防御，那不是更好吗？”
“这样推论是没有必要的，”史佩莱说。“航海的人不知道有林肯岛，连最新的地图上也没有把它标志出来。不过，赛勒斯，一只船无意之中发现了新的陆地，它只会去察看而不会错过的，你说是不是？”
“当然。”潘克洛夫答道。
“我也这么想，”工程师补充道。“甚至可以这样说：访问和察看还没被人发现的陆地或岛屿，这是船长的责任。而林肯岛正是一个这样的海岛。”
“那么，”潘克洛夫说，“假如这只船来了，并且就在离我们的岛几锚链的地方下了锚，我们该怎么办呢？”
这个突如其来的问题一时没有得到回答。赛勒斯•史密斯考虑了一会儿，然后和往常一样，用镇静的口气答道：
“怎么办？朋友们，应该这么办：我们要和船上取得联系，我们代表美国占有这个岛，然后乘这只船离开这里，将来再同愿意跟我们来的人回到岛上，明确地占领它，把太平洋上的这个有用的基地贡献给美利坚合众国。”
“哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我们送给国家的这份礼物可不小啊！开拓的手续差不多已经完了：岛上的每一部分都命了名，这里有天然港口、贮水场、道路、电报设备、船坞和一些制造场。只差把林肯岛标志在地图上了。”
“但是，假如有人乘我们不在的时候来夺取它呢？”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“该死！”水手喊道。“我宁可一个人留下来守着它。你们把这个任务交给我潘克洛夫吧，他们决不能象扒手那样把荒岛从我手里抢走的！”
一个钟头过去了，然而还不能确定这只船是不是向林肯岛开来。它近了一些，但是究竟是向着什么方向航行的呢？这一点潘克洛夫不能断定。不过，这时候正刮着东北风，那只船多半是向右方抢风行驶。并且现在向林肯岛开来又恰巧是顺风；海面上风平浪静，虽然地图上没有浅滩的标志，它尽可以放心大胆地开过来。
艾尔通在将近四点钟的时候——在邀请他的一小时之后——来到了“花岗石宫”。他走进餐厅，说：
“各位先生，有什么吩咐吗？”
赛勒斯•史密斯照例向他伸出手来，然后把他领到窗口。
“艾尔通，”他说，“我们请你来有一件重要的事情。我们发现了一只船。”
起初艾尔通的脸色略微一变．他的眼睛暂时暗淡下来，然后他从窗口探出身去，看了一下水平线，但是什么也没有瞧见。
“用望远镜仔细看一下！”史佩莱说，“艾尔通，也许是邓肯号到这里来接你回去了。”
“邓肯号！”艾尔通喃喃地说，接着，又不由自主地说道：“这么快就来了吗？”说完以后，他用两手捧着头。
在荒岛上独居了十二年，难道他还认为不足以弥补自己的罪恶吗？这个悔过自新的人，不论他自己看来也好，或是别人看来也好，难道还不觉得他已经得到宽恕了吗？
“不，”他说，“不是！决不是邓肯号。”
“你瞧，艾尔通，”工程师说，“我们一定要预先知道将要发生什么事。”
艾尔通拿起望远镜，朝着大家所指的方向看去。他默默地对着水平线一动也不动地看了几分钟，然后说：
“的确是一只船，但我想不是邓肯号。”
“为什么你认为不是邓肯号呢？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“因为邓肯号是一只游船，而这只船上和周围却连一点烟也看不见。”
“也许它是张着帆在行驶，”潘克洛夫说。“它现在的方向好象是顺风，离陆地这么远，它也许打算节省一些煤。”
“也许你说得对，潘克洛夫先生，”艾尔通答道，“这只船灭了火。我们只好等它走近一些。那时候就可以知道要发生什么事情了。”
说完以后，艾尔通就在房间的一个角落里坐了下来，不再说话了。移民们又谈起了这只陌生的船，但是艾尔通没有参加谈话。大家的心情都很激动，觉得工作不下去了。吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫特别显得神经过敏，他们不停地走来走去，一会儿也坐不住。赫伯特却感到好奇。只有纳布和平时一样的安静。难道他的主人所在的地方不是他的祖国吗？至于工程师，他正陷入沉思，他的心里与其说是盼望这只船来，还不如说是害怕它来。这时候，船离荒岛近一些了。他们从望远镜里可以确定：这是一只双桅船，而不是太平洋海盗常用的那种帆船。所以，现在不妨肯定：工程师的顾虑是不必要的，这只船在海岛附近出现并不会带来什么危险。潘克洛夫仔细看了一会以后，肯定这是一只双桅船，它张着中桅帆和上桅帆，正沿着右舷，斜对着海岸驶来。艾尔通也肯定了这一点。不过，那时刮的是西南风，要是双桅船继续向着这个方向驶来，它很快就要被爪角挡住的。那时候要守望它就必须爬到气球港附近华盛顿湾的高岗上去。糟糕的是，这时候已经是傍晚五点钟，在苍茫的暮色里，很快就要什么也看不见了。
“天黑了我们怎么办呢？”吉丁•史佩莱问道，“要不要到海边去燃起一堆火来，表示我们在这儿呢？”
这是一个重大的问题，虽然工程师还多少保留着他的预感，但最后还是同意了。在夜间这只船也许会一去不复返的，它走了以后，还会有别的船再到林肯岛附近来吗？谁能预见移民们的前途呢？
“是的，”通讯记者说，“不管它是什么船，我们都应该让它知道这个岛上有人居住。要是错过这个送上门来的机会，也许要一辈子遗憾的。”
于是大家决定由纳布和潘克洛夫到气球港去。在天黑的时候，燃起一堆火来，这样火光一定会引起船上注意的。
但是，纳布和水手正准备离开“花岗石宫”，那只船忽然改变了方向，直对联合湾驶去了。它驾驶得很熟练，很快就接近了海岸。于是，纳布和潘克洛夫暂时不走了。大家把望远镜交给艾尔通，让他肯定这只船究竟是不是邓肯号。苏格兰游船邓肯号也是一只双桅船。现在那只船离岸只有十英里了。需要看清楚的是：它的两根桅杆之间有没有烟囱。
水平线上还很清晰。察看起来非常容易。艾尔通很快放下望远镜说：
“不是邓肯号！不可能是它！”
潘克洛夫接过望远镜，对着来船。它的载重可以看出在三四百吨之间，船身非常狭窄，樯帆齐整，结构精巧好看，这一定是一只航海的快船。但是究竟是哪一国的船呢，这还很难说。
“不过，”水手接着说，“船顶上飘着一面旗，只是我还看不清它的颜色。”
“半小时以后就可以确定了，”通讯记者说，“并且，那只船的船长显然是想上岸，因此，不是今天就是明天，我们就可以和他见面了。”
“这个倒没有什么关系！”潘克洛夫说，“最好能知道我们要和什么样的人打交道，要是我能认出船旗就好了。”
水手说话的时候，始终没有离开望远镜。天黑了，风也随着停了下来，船上的旗帜垂成一卷，更不容易看清了。
“这不是美国旗，”潘克洛夫喃喃地说，“也不是英国旗，如果是英、美的旗帜，红颜色是很容易看出来的。也不是法国旗或德国旗，也不是俄国的白旗，也不是西班牙的黄旗。好象是一面单色旗。让我想一想，在这一带海面上，我们经常遇见的是哪种旗？智利旗吗？那是三色的。巴西旗吗？那是绿的。日本旗吗？那是黄色和黑色的，而这……”
这时候，微风又把这面陌生的船旗吹开了。艾尔通拿起水手放下的望远镜来一看，他暗哑地喊道；
“是一面黑旗！”
的确，一面阴沉沉的旗子在桅杆上飘扬着，现在他们不禁对来船感到可疑了！
那么，工程师的预感是不是对了呢？这是一只海盗船吗？它是不是在太平洋上出没，要和横行一时的马来船争霸呢？它到林肯岛沿岸来干什么？他们认为这是一个无名的荒岛，准备把它当作窝藏赃物的仓库吗，它是打算在沿岸找一个过冬的港口吗？难道居民们的这片净土注定了要成为不名誉的藏身所，成为太平洋海盗的巢穴吗？
他们不由地产生这些念头。此外，船旗的颜色当然是值得注意的。这是海盗的旗号！假如当初那批罪犯的罪恶阴谋得逞了的话，邓肯号也会挂上这种旗号的。大家立刻开始谈论起来。
“朋友们，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“也许这只船只是想在沿岸巡视一下。也许船上的人根本不会上岸，这也是可能的。但是，不管怎样，我们都必须尽可能隐蔽起来。眺望岗上的风磨太显眼了。艾尔通和纳布快去把风翼落下来。‘花岗石宫’的窗户也必须用树枝密密地遮住。把火全弄灭了，一点也不要暴露出岛上有人的样子来。”
“我们的船呢？”赫伯特说。
“噢，”潘克洛夫答道，“藏在气球港了，我不信那些流氓能够找到它！”
工程师的命令都立刻执行了。纳布和艾尔通爬上高地，作了必要的戒备，把一切住人的迹象都掩蔽起来。当他们进行这项工作的时候，其他的人到啄木鸟林的边缘去拾了许多树枝和爬藤回来。从远处看起来，它们好象天然的枝叶似的，“花岗石宫”的窗子就这样伪装起来了。同时，枪枝弹药也准备好了，以防突如其来的袭击。
等到一切都准备好以后，史密斯说：
“朋友们，”他的声音显得有些激动，“假如这些歹人想要侵占林肯岛，我们一定要保卫它，对不对？”
“对，赛勒斯，”通讯记者答道，“必要的时候，我们可以牺牲性命来保卫它！”
工程师向伙伴们伸出手来，大家都热烈地紧握着他的手。
只有艾尔通一个人还蹲在角落里，没有和大家在一起。这个过去的罪犯也许觉得自己还没有资格这样做！
赛勒斯•史密斯猜透了艾尔通的心思，就走到他身旁去。
“你，艾尔通，”他问道，“你打算怎样做呢？”
“尽我的责任。”艾尔通答道。
于是他站在窗边，从浓密的枝叶间向外看去。
那时正是七点半钟。太阳已经在二十分钟前消失在“花岗石宫”的后面了。因此东方的水平线逐渐朦胧起来。这时候，双桅船继续向联合湾驶去。它驶过爪角以后，就顺着上涨的潮流往北而去，因此，现在它正对着眺望岗的高地，离这里只不过两英里。双桅船这时候可算已经进入了宽广的海湾，假如在爪角和颚骨角之间画一条直线，那么这根线正通过船的右舷后部。
这只船是不是打算深入海湾呢？这是第一个问题。一旦入港以后，会不会在那边抛锚呢？这是第二个问题。最后，它会不会仅仅巡视一下，不让船员们上岸就开走呢？这些，在未来的一个钟头之内，他们都会知道的。但目前只能等待着。
赛勒斯•史密斯看了这只挂着黑旗的可疑的船以后，感到很不安心。他和他的伙伴们到现在为止工作得非常顺利，这只船会不会给他们的工作带来威胁呢？这只船的船员们不可能是别的，只可能是海盗，他们是不是曾经到这里来过，因此在驶近荒岛的时候，挂上他们的旗号呢？岛上过去发生过一些不能理解的怪事，这能不能说明他们曾经侵占过这个地方呢？有某些地方居民们还没有去探测过，那里是不是有海盗的同伙准备和船上的海盗联系呢？
史密斯暗暗地考虑着这些问题，不知道应该怎样回答；他只觉得双桅船来了以后，将要对他们的安全带来严重的威胁。
不管怎么样，他和他的伙伴还是决定要战斗到底。目前迫切需要知道：海盗的人数多不多，他们的武器是不是要比移民们装备得优越。但是怎么能得到这个情报呢？
黑夜来临了。新月已经消失。黑暗笼罩着荒岛和海洋。水平线上盖着黑压压的阴云，光线一丝也透不过来。风也随着暮色而消失了。听不见树叶沙沙作响，岸边也没有潺潺的水声。船上的灯火完全熄灭了，因此一点也看不见它。即使它还在荒岛的周围，也找不到它的行踪了。
“好吧！谁知道呢？”潘克洛夫说。“也许这只该死的船要在夜里开走，到明天早上我们就找不着它了。”
这时候，黑暗中突然闪出一道亮光，并且传来一声炮响，好象回答水手的问题似的。
船还在那里，并且船上还有炮。
亮光闪过之后六秒钟才听见炮声。
因此，这只船离岸大约一又四分之一英里。
这时候，铁链从链孔里哗啦啦地放了出来。
双桅船在“花岗石宫”的视线内抛锚了。
Book 3 Chapter 2
There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates' intentions. They had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the beach!
Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined though they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their presence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting themselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of the island. It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might escape their notice.
But why was that flag hoisted at the brig's peak? What was that shot fired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates' guns? A few muskets only.
"However," observed Cyrus Harding, "here we are in an impregnable position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate into Granite House."
"But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!" exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. "They may spoil everything, destroy everything in a few hours!"
"Everything, Pencroft," answered Harding, "and we have no means of preventing them."
"Are they numerous? that is the question," said the reporter. "If they are not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty, fifty, more perhaps!"
"Captain Harding," then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer, "will you give me leave?"
"For what, my friend?"
"To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew."
"But Ayrton--" answered the engineer, hesitating, "you will risk your life--"
"Why not, sir?"
"That is more than your duty."
"I have more than my duty to do," replied Ayrton.
"Will you go to the ship in the boat?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"No, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide between wind and water."
"Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?" said Herbert.
"I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert."
"I tell you it is risking your life," said the engineer.
"That is no matter," answered Ayrton. "Captain Harding, I ask this as a favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!"
"Go, Ayrton," replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.
"I will accompany you," said Pencroft.
"You mistrust me!" said Ayrton quickly.
Then more humbly,--
"Alas!"
"No! no!" exclaimed Harding with animation, "no, Ayrton, Pencroft does not mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly."
"Indeed," returned the sailor, "I only propose to accompany Ayrton as far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one of these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too many to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do so." These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night. Once arrived at the vessel's side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the pirates.
Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer less from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.
Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.
Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.
It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.
The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey, it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion.
In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided through the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.
Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors' trousers. He put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not sleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally struck Ayrton:--
"Our brig is a famous acquisition."
"She sails well, and merits her name of the 'Speedy.'"
"She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels."
"Hurrah for her captain!"
"Hurrah for Bob Harvey!"
What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one of his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his criminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had gone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches, more ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels, and massacring their crews.
The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew of the "Speedy" was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from Norfolk Island.
Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2' south latitude, and 165deg 42' east longitude, to the east of Australia, is found a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea. This is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were lodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries. They numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed under the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,--although very rarely,--notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.
Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly wished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig "Speedy," anchored in sight of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship had scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and well known to Ayrton!
The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a few, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.
The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton learned that chance alone had brought the "Speedy" in sight of Lincoln Island; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding had conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position being marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and, if he found it suitable, of making it the brig's headquarters.
As to the black flag hoisted at the "Speedy's" peak, and the gun which had been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their colors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.
The settlers' domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security. Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and Bob Harvey and his accomplices' first care would be to massacre them without mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts intended to reside there, and since, in the event of the "Speedy" departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it would be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of thinking.
But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she carried.
This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto the "Speedy's" deck, which the extinguished lanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding among the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the ship, and found that the "Speedy" carried four guns, which would throw shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching them that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern make, easily used, and of terrible effect.
As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on board. That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to contend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton's devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and would make his arrangements accordingly.
There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his companions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself, and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let himself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was to sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who, either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he thought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an honest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works destroyed, their island turned into a pirates' den! He said to himself that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a feeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had on board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his duty.
Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be enough to destroy it in an instant.
Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished with weapons of all sorts.
Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was loaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the brig's poop at the powder-magazine.
It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without stumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and kicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the magazine itself.
Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.
At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton's shoulder.
"What are you doing here?" asked a tail man, in a harsh voice, who, standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton's face.
Ayrton drew beck. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized his former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he must have thought Ayrton long since dead.
"What are you doing here?" again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the waistband.
But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and attempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the powder-casks, and all would be over!
"Help, lads!" shouted Bob Harvey.
At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from their grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder.
Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project. Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement on the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must reserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing for him but flight!
But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions.
Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were fired-- one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his adversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck. Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at the same moment.
A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not understanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea.
Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him like hail.
What were Pencroft's feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel any attack.
They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates, had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night to make a descent on the island!
Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded? Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The tide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat was not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession of Harding and his companions!
At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft, safe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.
All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had attempted to put into execution.
All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that their situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers and well armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall into their hands, they must expect no mercy!
"Well, we shall know how to die!" said the reporter.
"Let us go in and watch," answered the engineer.
"Have we any chance of escape, captain?" asked the sailor.
"Yes, Pencroft."
"Hum! six against fifty!"
"Yes! six! without counting--"
"Who?" asked Pencroft.
Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.
海盗们的企图已经很明显了。他们在离岛不远的地方抛了锚，显然准备第二天利用小艇在海滩上登陆！
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们随时准备采取行动。虽然他们下定了决心，但还是不能麻痹大意。假如海盗们登陆以后，不到岛内来视察的话，他们还可以隐藏起来。海盗们也许只想从慈悲河里取一些淡水。如果真是这样的话，他们也可能不会发现离河口一英里半的那座桥和“石窟”的工场。
但是船顶上为什么要挂起那面旗呢？为什么要开那一炮呢？毫无疑问，这纯粹是示威性质，要不然就是表示他们占领荒岛了。史密斯现在知道，船上的武器装备得十分完备，林肯岛上的移民应该用什么来对付海盗们的炮火呢？只不过有几支滑膛枪罢了。
“不管怎么样，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们的阵地是攻不破的。现在‘花岗石宫’的出口有芦苇和乱草掩蔽着，敌人是不会发现它的，因此他们就不可能攻进来。”
“但是我们的农场，家禽场，畜栏，我们的一切！”潘克洛夫一面跺脚一面嚷道。“要不了几个钟头，他们就会把这一切都给毁了的！”
“是的，一切都会被毁灭的，潘克洛夫。”史密斯答道，“可是我们没法阻止他们。”
“他们人多吗，这是一个问题，”通讯记者说。“要是他们只有十来个人，我们是能够阻止他们的，但是也许有四十、五十，或者更多呢！”
“史密斯先生，”艾尔通一面向工程师走过来，一面说，“你能让我去一趟吗？”
“去干什么，朋友？”
“到船上去探听一下敌人的实力。”
“但是，艾尔通……”工程师犹豫不决地答道，“你这样做是有生命危险的……”
“为什么不可以呢，先生？”
“这不是你份内的事。”
“份外的事我也应该做。”艾尔通答道。
“你打算坐小船去吗？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“不，先生，我泅水去。坐船会被他们发现的，光一个人却可以从风浪之间游过去。”
“那只船离岸有一又四分之一英里，你知道吗？”赫伯特说。
“我是一个熟谙水性的人，赫伯特先生。”
“我告诉你，这样做是有生命危险的。”工程师说。
“不要紧，”艾尔通答道。“史密斯先生，我请求你答应我的要求，我认为这也许是我重新做人的一个机会。”
“去吧，艾尔通。”工程师答道，他深信如果拒绝他的请求，这个改邪归正的罪犯一定会深深地感到伤心的。
“我跟你一起去。”潘克洛夫说。
“那你就是不信任我！”艾尔通立刻说。
然后他又腼腆地叹息了一声：“唉！”
“不要这样！不要这样！”史密斯带着鼓舞的口气大声说，“别误会，艾尔通，潘克洛夫并不是不信任你。你误解他的意思了。”
“的确是这样，”水手说，“我只是提议把艾尔通送到小岛上。虽然可能性很小，但也许有匪徒已经上岸了。在这种情况下，要阻止他发出警报，两个人不算多吧。既然他提议要单独去，我就在小岛上等他，让他一个人上船。”
事情商量妥当以后，艾尔通就准备出发了。他的计划很冒险，但是夜色非常昏暗，或者有成功的可能。只要能到达船边，抓住主要的链条，艾尔通就可以侦查出船上的人数，甚至也许还能偷听到海盗们的意图。
艾尔通和潘克洛夫在伙伴们的陪伴之下，来到下面的海滩上。艾尔通脱掉衣服，在身上抹上一层油，以免受冻，因为海水还很凉。事实上他也许不得不在水里呆几个钟头。
这时候，潘克洛夫和纳布去搬停在慈悲河上几百英尺的那只小船了。他们回来的时候，艾尔通把衣服搭在肩膀上，只等动身了。居民们都跑过来和他握手。
于是艾尔通和潘克洛夫把船撑开了。
十点半的时候，这两个冒险家消失在黑暗中了。他们的伙伴们到“石窟”那里去等待着他们。
小船顺利地渡过海峡，在对面的小岛上靠了岸。他们一举一动非常小心，深怕有海盗在那里溜达。经过仔细侦察以后，肯定小岛上并没有人。于是潘克洛夫跟在艾尔通后面，急急忙忙穿过小岛，石洞里的飞鸟也被他们惊动起来了。然后，艾尔通毫不迟疑地往海里一跳，无声无息地朝着双桅船游过去。船上刚刚亮起灯光，正好标示出它的正确位置。潘克洛夫蹲在乱石堆里面，等他的伙伴回来。
这时候，艾尔通在水面上用力向前游去，丝毫也没有发出水声。他仅仅把头露出水面，两眼注视着暗黑的船身。船上的灯光倒映在水里。他所考虑的只有自己保证完成任务，至于船上的和这一带常有鲨鱼出没的海里的危险，却一点也没有想到。水流带着他前进，很快就离开了海岸。
半个钟头以后，艾尔通神不知鬼不觉地到了船边，抓住船上的主链。他喘了一口气，然后攀着主链，一直爬到船的最前端。有几条水手裤晾在那里，他穿上一条，然后稳稳地站住了脚，静静地倾听着。船上的人都没有睡，相反地，有的在谈笑，有的在唱歌。他们一面高谈阔论，一面谩骂，最使艾尔通触到隐痛的是这几句话：
“我们得来的这只船真是刮刮叫。”
“在海里航行起来真不错，不愧称为‘飞快’号。”
“诺福克的船队没有一只能追得上它。”
“船长万岁！”
“鲍勃•哈维万岁！”
艾尔通无意听到了鲍勃•哈维的名字，这个人是一个胆大包天的水手，同时也是艾尔通过去的澳洲伙伴，他现在还在继续干犯罪的勾当。当艾尔通听到这段谈话的时候，他的心情是可以想象的。鲍勃•哈维在诺福克岛的海岸掠夺了这只双桅船，船上装载着武器、弹药、器皿和各种工具。这只船原来是打算开往三明治群岛的一个岛屿去的，自从被他抢到手以后，那一帮罪犯就成了海盗。这些匪徒出没在太平洋上，抢劫过往的船只，屠杀船上的人，比马来海盗还要惨无人道。
罪犯们一面开怀畅饮，一面高声谈笑，追述着过去所做的那些可耻的勾当。艾尔还从他们的谈话里知道：飞快号上的船员都是从诺福克岛上逃出来的英国罪犯。
现在不妨谈一谈诺福克岛的情况。在澳大利亚以东，南纬29度2分，东经165度42分的地方，有一个小岛，周围六法里，岛上有一座华特山，拔海一千一百英尺。这个诺福克岛上曾经监禁过英国感化院里最顽固的罪犯。当时岛上的罪犯有五百名，岛上不但纪律森严，而且有苦刑威胁着他们。此外还有一百五十名士兵监管，这一百五十名士兵都是听总督指挥的。很难想象有比他们更坏的暴徒聚在一起了。虽然对他们的监管非常严厉，有时候还是有些人逃跑，不过这种事是很少的。他们突袭船只，把船抢过来，在玻里尼西亚群岛一带到处骚扰。
鲍勃•哈维和他的伙伴过去就是这样做的。这也就是艾尔通从前的愿望。鲍勃•哈维掠夺了停在诺福克岛附近的飞快号，把船上的人都杀死了；一年来，他指挥着这只船在太平洋上到处骚扰，现在他是一个海盗了，而且他是艾尔通的旧相识！
这些罪犯大部分都在船尾仓内，但是也有几个躺在甲板上高谈阔论。
他们一面饮酒喊叫，一面继续谈话。艾尔通知道飞快号是偶然来到林肯岛附近的。鲍勃•哈维从来也没有到林肯岛上来过。正和赛勒斯•史密斯所想的一样，他在航行中发现了这块地图上所没有的陌生陆地，就打定主意要到岛上来视察一番，要是中意的话，就把它当作双桅船的大本营。
至于飞快号上所挂的黑旗，和模仿军舰在降旗时鸣放的礼炮，那纯粹是海盗的示威行为，决不是什么信号，因为当时他们和林肯岛上并没有什么联系。
居民们的领地现在面临着严重的危险了。荒岛上有贮水场和港口，还有可以藏身的“花岗石宫”；此外，经过居民们的努力开发，岛上的各种资源变得更有价值了。这一切对罪犯们说来，显然是非常便利的。它一旦落在海盗们的手里，就将要成为优越的藏身之地；而且既然没有人知道这个地方，可能在很长的一段时间内，都能保证他们安全无事。显然，他们是不会重视居民们的生命的。鲍勃•哈维和他的部下所考虑的头一桩事，就是要惨无人道地杀死他们。由于这些罪犯打算在岛上住下来，并且当飞快号出去打劫的时候，还可能要留下几个人来看守，史密斯和他的伙伴们就要束手无策了。因此，只好进行斗争，只好不惜采用任何手段把这些不值得同情的恶棍全部歼灭。艾尔通这样想着，他知道赛勒斯•史密斯一定也会这样想的。
但是抵抗和取得最后胜利是不是可能呢？这就要看船上的装备和人数了。
艾尔通决定不惜任何代价查清楚这一点。他上船一个钟头以后，船上的喧哗声逐渐静下来了。不少的罪犯已经烂醉如泥，于是艾尔通就毫不犹豫地冒险爬上飞快号的甲板。那时灯光已经灭了，仓面上一片漆黑。他抓住船头，攀住牙樯，爬到前甲板上，从东倒西歪的罪犯们中间穿过去，在船上绕了一周，发现飞快号装备着四门大炮，这些炮可以发射八磅至十磅重的炮弹。他用手一摸，知道都是后膛炮，这种炮非常新颖，操纵灵便，威力极大。
甲板上大约躺着十个人，但是一定还有很多人睡在下面。从他们的谈话里，艾尔通知道船上一共有五十个人。对林肯岛上的六个居民来说，要和这么多的人战斗，实在不是一件容易的事！多亏艾尔通一片热心，现在赛勒斯•史密斯可以知道敌人的实力，并且可以适当地进行安排，不致惊慌失措了。
艾尔通已经完成任务，只等回去把任务的完成情况告诉伙伴们了，他准备摸索到船头，然后下水。
但是，正象他自己所说的，份外的工作他也要做，因此他产生了一个英勇的念头：牺牲自己的性命，来挽救林肯岛和岛上的移民。赛勒斯•史密斯肯定是打不过这五十名匪徒的。海盗们的武器精良，不论是集中主力直捣“花岗石宫”，还是用围困的方法使他们饿死，都能够达到他们的目的。这时候艾尔通又想起了他的保护人，他们使他脱胎换骨，成了一个好人，对他来说，真是恩重如山。但是，他们将要无情地遭到屠杀了，他们的劳动成果将要遭到毁坏，他们的岛屿将要沦为海盗的巢穴！他对自己说：他就是造成这许多不幸后果的主要原因，因为他的老伙伴鲍勃•哈维只不过是实现了他过去的计划。想到这里，他不由得毛发悚然。于是，他产生了一个一不做二不休的意图，诀定炸毁这只船和全船的人。即使他自己也要在爆炸的时候牺牲，但是他总算尽到自己的责任了。
艾尔通丝毫也没有迟疑。要找火药库并不困难，因为它通常总是在船的后半部。做这种勾当的船是不会缺少火药的，只要一粒火星，就可以顿时把它炸毁了。
艾尔通悄悄地沿着中仓甲板走去，甲板上到处都躺着熟睡的人，他们大多是喝醉的而不是睡着的。主桅的底部点着一盏灯，周围支着一个枪架，上面各种武器都有。
艾尔通从枪架上拿了一支左轮枪。他看了一下，知道里面装满了弹药。这就足够用来完成这件破坏工作了。于是他直奔船尾，到后仓下的火药库去。
甲板上光线很暗，要想走过去，而不被那些半睡半醒的罪犯绊倒却不是一件容易的事。每当他绊在他们身上，他们就开口谩骂，或是一脚踢过来。因此艾尔通不得不一再停下脚步来。终于来到后仓的隔板旁边，并且找到了通往火药库的那扇门。
艾尔通没有别的办法开门，只有用力把它打开，于是他就动手打门了。要想进行这项工作，必须砸坏门上的挂锁，这样做是难免要发出一些响声的。但是他的腕力很大，一下子拧坏了挂锁，库门开了。
这时候，忽然有一只手搭在艾尔通的肩膀上。
“你在这里做什么？”一个高个子的人站在幻影里，粗鲁地问道，他很快地把灯光照在艾尔通的脸上。
艾尔通倒退几步。灯光一闪，他认出了这正是他当年的伙伴鲍勃•哈维，但是对方一定已经不认识他，因为他以为艾尔通早就死了。
“你在这里做什么？”鲍勃•哈维抓住艾尔通的腰带，又问了一句。
可是艾尔通没有回答，他挣脱了他的手，打算冲到火药库里去。只要对着火药箱放一枪，就大功告成了！
“帮忙呀，伙计们！”鲍勃•哈维大叫起来。
两三个强盗被他喊醒了。他们跳起身来，向艾尔通扑过去，想把他扳倒在地上。他立刻闪开身子，开了两枪，两个罪犯倒下去了。但是他自己也因为来不及躲避，肩膀上被砍了一刀。
艾尔通眼看自己的计划不可能实现了。鲍勃•哈维已经把火药库门关好，并且甲板上稍一响动，海盗们全都惊醒了过来。艾尔通必须保全自己来帮助赛勒斯•史密斯战斗。因此他只好逃走！
但是，还逃得了吗？这是一个问题。不过，艾尔通决定要尽一切努力回到伙伴们那里去。
他的枪里还剩下四颗子弹。刚才打的两颗，有一颗打的是鲍勃•哈维，但没有把他打伤，至多也不过是微伤。艾尔通乘着敌人暂时后退的工夫，冲上扶梯往甲板跑去。经过灯下面的时候，他用枪托一下子把灯打灭了。于是周围一片漆黑，他就便于逃跑了。这时候，有两三个海盗惊醒了，他们从扶梯上跑下来。艾尔通的第五枪打倒了其中的一个，其余的还不知道发生了什么事情，就往后退去。艾尔通两步跳上了甲板，三秒钟以后，一个海盗几乎掐住他的咽喉，他的最后一颗子弹打中了这个海盗的脸，然后他就越过舷栏往海里跳去。
艾尔通划了不到六下，枪弹就象冰雹似的向他周围打过来了。
船上的枪声响了，躲在小岛岩石下的潘克洛夫会怎样想呢？蹲在“石窟”里的史密斯、通讯记者、赫伯特和纳布又会怎样想呢？他们四个人扛着枪冲到海滩上，随时准备抵抗敌人的攻击。
他们以为艾尔通一定是遭到了海盗的突击，已经被打死了。也许匪徒们还要乘黑夜到岛上来呢！
他们焦急不安地等了半个钟头。枪声已经停止了，但是艾尔通和潘克洛夫都没有回来。小岛已经被敌人侵占了吗？他们应该赶快去援救艾尔通和潘克洛夫吗？怎么去呢？这时候正在涨潮，海峡是渡不过去的。船又不在这里！史密斯和他的伙伴的焦急是不难想象的！
将近十二点半的时候，他们两个人所乘的小船终于靠岸了。艾尔通肩膀上受了轻伤，潘克洛夫还是安然无恙，大家都用热烈的拥抱来欢迎他们。
他们立刻躲到“石窟”里去。在那里，艾尔通把全部经过都说了一遍，还说到他打算毁灭这只船的计划。
人人都向艾尔通伸出手来。艾尔通也坦白地表示他们的处境是非常危险的。海盗惊动了。他们已经知道林肯岛上有人。他们会全副武装，强行登陆的。他们是什么也不会顾忌的。居民们一旦落在他们的手里，就不要想活命。
“好吧，我们不会白白牺牲的！”通讯记者说。
“我们进去守望吧。”工程师答道。
“我们还有逃脱的机会吗，史密斯先生？”水手问道。
“有的，潘克洛夫。”
“嘿！六对五十！”
“是的！六个！不包括……”
“谁？”潘克洛夫问道。
赛勒斯指着上面，没有回答。
Book 3 Chapter 3
The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive, and did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their side, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last shots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal with her match, and had left the coast.
But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could see a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the "Speedy."
"These, my friends," said the engineer, "are the arrangements which appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It hides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting their attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and consequently capable of resisting them. I therefore propose that we divide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted at the Chimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think it would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and four muskets. Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot, we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to fear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they do against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the necessity of meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side. We must therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but with a sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they must be killed!"
Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece of work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these arrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and Ayrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a mile. The four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.
The posts were arranged in the following manner:--
Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.
Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.
As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet. In this way, shots being fired from four different points at once, the convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely peopled and strongly defended.
In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being cut off by the brig's boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their boat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.
Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time wrung each other's hands.
Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.
In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.
None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely distinguish the brig in the fog.
It was half-past six in the morning.
Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued from the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.
The "Speedy" now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as Harding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast.
The sinister black flag floated from the peak.
The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board were pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a moment's notice.
In the meanwhile the "Speedy" remained silent. About thirty pirates could be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others posted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively surveying the island.
Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an account of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had this half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and with whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver at them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot? Had he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his object? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts' minds. But what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before which the "Speedy" had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was, perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be absolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had the inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter the locality before he allowed his men to venture there.
During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be observed on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even with his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the settlers crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his attention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers hiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on the bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out, at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited.
At eight o'clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board the "Speedy." A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They were armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars, and the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered the island. Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to land, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The pirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width. However, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the direction followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel, but would land on the islet.
Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them coming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.
The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the water at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that it was Bob Harvey's intention to bring his brig as near as possible to the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed every movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks which would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more than two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.
At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the rocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line fell backwards into the boat. Ayrton's and Pencroft's balls had struck them both at the same moment.
Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued from the brig's side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two marksmen remained unhurt.
Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued its way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However, instead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat coasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the bullets.
They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a semicircular line, still protected by the brig's guns, they proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy.
Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their number might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous position.
A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction. Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.
Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the "Speedy's" guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.
Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as they were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.
The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.
The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current, it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.
Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries had certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be destroyed one by one.
It was now seen how advantageous the engineer's arrangements had been. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.
Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current, could get alongside the "Speedy." Frightful cries were heard when they returned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired with no results.
But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly by the effect of the evening's potations, threw themselves into the boat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their places, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the Mercy.
The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.
However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two well- directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran across the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the channel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran to hide themselves in the Chimneys.
They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet was overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment, fresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat was rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her, were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself, carried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the Mercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to preserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of the balls.
The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts, of whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their disposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility reach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges being raised.
"Hallo," exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, "hallo, captain! What do you think of it, now?"
"I think," answered the engineer, "that the combat will now take a new form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!"
"They won't cross the channel," said the sailor. "Ayrton and Mr. Spilett's rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry more than a mile!"
"No doubt," replied Herbert; "but what can two rifles do against the brig's guns?"
"Well, the brig isn't in the channel yet, I fancy!" said Pencroft.
"But suppose she does come there?" said Harding.
"That's impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!"
"It is possible," said Ayrton. "The convicts might profit by the high tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no longer tenable."
"Confound them!" exclaimed Pencroft, "it really seems as if the blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor."
"Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!" observed Herbert.
"We must wait!" answered Cyrus Harding.
"But Mr. Spilett and Neb?" said Pencroft.
"They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is yours and Spilett's rifles which must speak now."
It was only too true. The "Speedy" was beginning to weigh her anchor, and her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would be rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already weakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering the channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton's opinion, could not believe that she would dare to attempt it.
In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel.
Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers, in ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing the latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they surveyed the islet, and examined the shore.
Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton's and Gideon Spilett's rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.
Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and pulled away with all their strength.
"Eight less!" exclaimed Pencroft. "Really, one would have thought that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!"
"Gentlemen," said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, "this is becoming more serious. The brig is making sail!"
"The anchor is weighed!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Yes, and she is already moving."
In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The "Speedy" was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been raised, she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island.
From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short distance, to the brig's guns, without being able to reply with any effect? How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?
Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even, since they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that? The pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having their revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.
However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all, would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep outside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive.
"Never!" repeated Pencroft, "Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig, if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without his vessel?"
In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen that she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light, and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had absolute command over his vessel.
The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.
The pirate's design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.
Soon the "Speedy" reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood across the mouth of the Mercy.
"The scoundrels! they are coming!" said Pencroft.
At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.
The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at the moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not without attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached them.
"Spilett! Neb!" cried the engineer. "You are not wounded?"
"No," answered the reporter, "a few bruises only from the ricochet! But that cursed brig has entered the channel!"
"Yes," replied Pencroft, "and in ten minutes she will have anchored before Granite House!"
"Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?" asked the reporter.
"We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the convicts cannot see us."
"That is, my opinion, too," replied Gideon Spilett, "but once shut up--"
"We must be guided by circumstances," said the engineer.
"Let us be off, then, and make haste!" said the reporter.
"Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?" asked the sailor.
"What would be the use of that, Pencroft?" replied Harding. "No. We will not separate!"
There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig, but two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told them that the "Speedy" was at no great distance.
To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to rush into the large room, was the work of a minute only.
It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the "Speedy," surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was incessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they were hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding's precaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door, penetrated into the passage.
"We are discovered!" exclaimed Pencroft.
The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage which concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite.
The colonists' situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered. They could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the stone, which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be done but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave their dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by frightful cries!
Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows--
The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal crew!
这一夜平安无事地过去了。居民们面临着生死关头，并没有离开他们在“石窟”的岗位。另一方面海盗们好象并没有上岸的企图。自从船上对艾尔通放了最后一枪以后，就没有再放一枪，甚至也没有一点声音可以说明它还在小岛附近。莫非它已经拔锚启航了？也许它怕和对手交锋，已经离开海岸了吧？
但是，并不是这么一回事，破晓的时候，居民们透过清晨的薄雾可以看见一团朦胧的黑影，那就是飞快号。
“朋友们，”工程师说，“雾可以使海盗看不见我们，使我们的行动不会引起海盗们的注意。最要紧的是，要让那些罪犯认为岛上的人很多，足够抵抗他们。因此，在雾散以前，我认为我们最好这样准备：把我们的人分成三路，第一路在‘石窟’这儿把守，第二路在慈悲河口把守。至于第三路，我想最好放在小岛上，因为在那里可以阻止他们——至少能牵制他们——登陆。我们有两支步枪和四支滑膛枪。每个人都武装起来，我们有的是弹药，可以尽量放。我们不必害怕船上的滑膛枪，就是大炮也不必顾虑。有这些岩石掩护着。他们还能怎么样呢？我们只要不从‘花岗石宫’的窗口往外开枪，他们就不会用炮把它炸得不可收拾了。所怕的就是进行肉搏战，因为罪犯们人数多。所以，我们一定要想法子不让他们登陆，同时又不能暴露自己。因此，不要舍不得用弹药。尽量开枪，但是要瞄准了再放。我们一个人要争取打死八个到十个敌人，一定要把他们完全消灭掉！”
赛勒斯•史密斯已经把他们的情况解释清楚了。他的嗓音很镇定，好象在调度一件工作，而不是指挥一场战斗似的。他的同伴们都默默地同意了这个部署。现在要做的，就是在雾散以前各就各位，没有别的事了。纳布和潘克洛夫立刻到“花岗石宫”上面去，拿了大量的弹药回来。吉丁•史佩莱和艾尔通都是射击能手，他们每人拿了一支射程几乎能够达到一英里的步枪。四支滑膛枪分给了史密斯、纳布、潘克洛夫和赫伯特。
各个人的岗位是这样布置的：
赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特埋伏在“石窟”附近，负责把守“花岗石宫”下面的海岸。
吉丁•史佩莱和纳布埋伏在慈悲河口的岩石中间，河上的吊桥已经扯起来，他们负责阻止任何人乘船渡河或在对岸登陆。
艾尔通和潘克洛夫要划船渡过海峡，在小岛上各据一点。这样，火力可以同时从四个不同的地点发射，罪犯们就会认为岛上不但有很多人，而且有坚强的防卫了。
如果艾尔通和潘克洛夫不能阻止海盗登陆，而且跟着将要被海盗的小船切断退路，他们就应该乘船回到岸上来，到受威胁的地点去。
在出发到各个阵地以前，移民们作了最后一次的握手。
潘克洛夫拥抱着他的孩子赫伯特，竭力抑制住自己的感情，然后他们就分手了。
过了一会儿，史密斯和赫伯特在一起，通讯记者和纳布在一起，都消失在岩石后面了。艾尔通和潘克洛夫也只用了五分钟就顺利地渡过海峡，登上了小岛，各自隐藏在东岸的岩石丛中间。
他们都看不见了，他们自己也看不清雾里的那只船。
这时候是早上六点半。
不久雾就逐渐散开，船的中桅在水气里露了出来。几分钟后大片的浓雾滚过海面，很快就被微风吹散了。
这时候飞快号完全露了出来，它的锚链上系着一根曳索，船头向北，左舷对着海岛。正象史密斯所估计的那样，它离岸不过一又四分之一英里。
阴沉沉的黑旗还在船上飘扬着。
工程师在望远镜里看见船上的四门炮都对着荒岛。显然它们随时都准备开火。
这时候，飞快号还是没有动静。大约有三十个海盗在甲板上走动着。有几个在船尾；另外有两个站在桅索中间，手里拿着小型望远镜，仔细观察海岛。
显然，鲍勃•哈维和他的部下是很难理解夜里船上所发生的情况的。那个半裸体的人用强力打开了火药库的门，并且和他们进行了格斗，他一共开了六枪，打死了他们的一个，打伤了两个，这个人最后被他们打死了吗？他到岸上去了吗？他是从哪里来的呢？他的目的是什么？真象鲍勃•哈维所想的那样，想炸毁双桅船吗？这些问题一定使罪犯们完全摸不着头脑。但是，有一点他们是可以肯定的：飞快号面前的这个无名海岛上是有人居住的，而且这里可能有许多移民随时准备保卫它。然而，不论是岸上也好，还是高岗上也好，都看不见一个人。海滩上好象完全没有人似的，至少是找不到一点房屋的影子。是不是居民们都逃到内陆去了呢？这个海盗船长大概就是这样揣测的，他非常精细，一定会首先进行侦察，然后再让他的部下上岸的。
一个半钟头过去了，船上还是没有准备进攻或登陆的样子。显然，鲍勃•哈维还在迟疑不决。尽管使用倍数最大的望远镜，潜伏在岩石里的居民，他还是一个也看不见。至于“花岗石宫”的窗口所遮的绿枝和爬藤，虽然在光滑的岩石上显得相当触目，大概根本就没有引起他的注意。的确，他怎么想得到，在这样高的地方，人们竟能把坚硬的花岗石台成一个可以居住的房屋呢。从爪角起沿着整个的联合湾直到颚骨角，没有任何东西可以使他认为岛上有人或是可能有人。
八点钟的时候，移民们终于看见飞快号上有人行动了。一只小船放了下来，七个人跳了进去。他们都带着滑膛枪。他们一个人掌着操舵索，四个人操着桨，另外两个人伏在船头侦察岛上的行动，随时准备开火。他们的目的很明显是要作一次侦察，而不是要登陆。假如打算登陆的话，来的人一定会更多的。海盗们从他们的了望台上可以看到，荒岛的海岸有一个小岛掩护着，岛和小岛之间的海峡宽半英里。可是，赛勒斯•史密斯根据小船的前进方向立刻判明，他们并不打算进入海峡，而是要在小岛上登陆。
潘克洛夫和艾尔通各自隐藏在岩石的夹缝里，看着小船直向他们划来，等着它进入射程以内。
小船小心翼翼地前进着，每隔很长时间才划一次桨。现在可以看见，有一个罪犯手里拿着一根铅垂线，打算测量被慈悲河冲陷的海峡有多深。这说明鲍勃•哈维打算尽量把船靠近海岸。船上有三十来个海盗在索具之间注视小船的行动，并寻找着可以安全靠岸的界标。小船在离小岛不到两锚链的地方停住了。掌舵的人站起身来，寻找最适合上岸的地方。
这时候只听见两声枪响。轻烟从小岛的岩石间袅袅上升。掌舵的人和测水的人都倒在船里了。艾尔通和潘克洛夫的枪弹同时打中了他们两个人。
几乎同时又听到更大的一声炮响，双桅船的船边喷出一团烟雾，一个炮弹落在掩护艾尔通和潘克洛夫的岩石顶上，炸得碎石横飞，但是两个射击手都没有受伤。
小船上的人破口大骂，并且立刻继续往前驶来。掌舵的已经换了一个人，其他的人迅速地划着奖。出乎意料的是它不但没有掉头回去，反而沿岸驶来，打算绕过小岛的南端。海盗们排命划船，想逃出步枪的射程。
他们绕了半个圆圈之后，来到离遗物角岸边五锚链以内的地方，继续在双桅船大炮的掩护下，向慈悲河口驶去。
他们的意图显然是想进入海峡，切断小岛上移民的归路，不管小岛上有多少人，要使他们处在两船的火力之间这个非常不利的地位里。
小船继续对着这个方向前进了一刻钟。周围一点声音也没有，海面上风平浪静。
潘克洛夫和艾尔通知道自己有被切断的危险，但是他们并没有离开岗位，他们不愿在进攻的敌人和飞快号的炮火前暴露自己；同时他们相信，防守着河口的纳布和吉丁•史佩莱，以及埋伏在“石窟”附近岩石间的赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特会援助他们的。
在第一次射击以后二十分钟，小船离慈悲河不到两锚链了。这时候正开始涨潮，由于海峡很窄，水势照例非常湍急。海盗们的船被冲到河口去了，他们费尽了九牛二虎之力，才保持在海峡的中流。但是，当海盗驶进慈悲河口的适当距离以内的时候，纳布和史佩莱马上敬了他们两枪，这两枪都没有落空，小船里又有两个人倒下了。
船上立刻对准冒烟的地方又开了一炮，但还是和刚才一样，只是把岩石打得粉碎。
现在小船上只剩下三个有用的人了。它顺着水流，象箭一般地冲过了海峡，经过史密斯和赫伯特的前面。他们认为还不在射程以内，就没有射击。然后小船在仅存的双桨推动下，绕过小岛的北端，回到双桅船那里去了。
到目前为止，岛上的人是没有什么可抱怨的。他们的敌人却倒了大楣，已经有四个海盗不是死，就是重伤了。相反的，居民们却都没有受伤，而且每枪都打中了敌人。假如海盗继续这样进攻，假如他们还打算利用小船登陆的话，那么，他们是可以一个一个地被歼灭的。
现在可以看出工程师调度有方了。海盗们会认为对方不但人多势众，而且武器优良，不是轻易可以取胜的。
小船逆水划行，半个钟头以后，才靠拢飞快号。当他们和受伤的人回到船上时，只听得一片鬼哭神嚎，接着又毫无目的地开了两三枪。
但是，现在又有十来个罪犯怒不可遏地跳进小船来了，他们可能还受着夜来狂欢的影响。同时又放下第二只小船来，里面坐着八个人。第一只小船直向小岛划去，打算赶走小岛上的移民，第二只准备强袭慈悲河口。
在这种情况之下，潘克洛夫和艾尔通的处境显然非常危险，他们觉得非回本岛不可了。
但是，他们还是等第一只小船进入射程以内，然后准确地开了两枪，小船上的人立刻陷入了混乱状态。潘克洛夫和艾尔通这才冒着密集的火力，离开了他们的阵地，飞快地穿过小岛，跳进小船。当第二只小船到达南端时，他们已经渡过海峡，藏到“石窟”里去了。
他们刚回到赛勒斯•史密斯和赫伯特的身旁，海盗们就占据了小岛各处。这时候慈悲河口也传来了枪声。海盗的第二只小船正在很快地向慈悲河口驶去。船上的八个人当中，有两个被吉丁•史佩莱和纳布打得奄奄一息。小船在没法控制的情况下往礁石上撞击，到慈悲河口的时候，小船进水了。但是，那六个活着的人高举着滑膛枪以防浸水，却登上了河的右岸。等他们发觉自己暴露在埋伏的火力范围内的时候，就向着遗物角枪弹打不到的地方逃去了。
实际情况是这样的：小岛上有十二个罪犯，其中有几个肯定是受伤了，但是他们还有一只小船。岛上有六个罪犯，由于吊桥都已经扯起来，不能过河，因此他们是到不了“花岗石宫”那里的。
“喂，”潘克洛夫闯进“石窟”，大声说，“喂，史密斯先生，现在，你看该怎么办？”
“我想，”工程师答道，“现在转入一个新的战斗局面了。罪犯们决不会这么傻，甘心守住这么不利的阵地！”
“他们渡不过海峡的，”水手说。“有艾尔通和史佩莱先生在那里，就可以阻挡他们。你知道，他们的步枪能打到一英里以外去呢！”
“当然，”赫伯特答道，“但是，两支步枪怎么能抵挡双桅船上的大炮呢。”
“船还没有到海峡里来呢！”潘克洛夫说。
“但是，假如它到海峡里来呢？”史密斯问道。
“那是不可能的，它要是那样做，就可能要搁浅和复灭了！”
“这还是可能的，”艾尔通说，“在落潮的时候，不错，可能有搁浅的危险；但是罪犯们也许会乘涨潮的时候到海峡里来的。那时候，在它的炮火下，我们的阵地就守不住了。”
“该死！”潘克洛夫喊道，“这帮可恶的家伙真好象是在起锚似的。”
“我们也许只好躲到‘花岗石宫’里去了！”赫伯特说。
“还是再等一会儿！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“可是史佩莱先生和纳布呢？”潘克洛夫说。
“他们到时候会上我们这儿来的。艾尔通，准备好。现在该用到你和史佩莱的步枪了。”
果然，飞快号起锚了。它显然打算驶近小岛。退潮的时间已经过去了，潮水还要上涨一个半钟头，在这种情况下，双桅船前进起来是非常方便的。至于说开进海峡，潘克洛夫不同意艾尔通的意见，他认为双桅船是不敢这样冒险的。
这时候，小岛上的海盗已经逐渐来到对岸边上，和本岛相隔只有一道海峡了。
海盗们只有滑膛枪，因此伤不着埋伏在“石窟”和慈悲河口的居民。海盗们想不到对方备有射程遥远的步枪，因此自己暴露在对方的火力之下还不知道。于是，他们就在毫无掩蔽的情况下，观察小岛，并巡视海岸。
他们的妄想不久就破灭了。艾尔通和吉丁•史佩莱的步枪响了起来。毫无疑问，枪弹给罪犯们带来了不幸的消息，其中有两个倒下去了。
于是他们都惊慌起来。其余的十个人顾不得伤亡的伙伴，都在小岛的另一边飞快地逃去，连滚带爬地上了乘来的小船，拚命划开了。
“少了八个了！”潘克洛夫喊道。“的确，史佩莱先生和艾尔通简直就好象听了口令，同时开枪似的。”
“诸位，”艾尔通一面说，一面装上子弹，“情况更加严重了。双桅船准备开动了！”
“它在起锚呢！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“是的，它已经动了。”
事实上，他们已经能够清清楚楚地听到绞盘的声音。飞快号起初是被锚拉住的，起锚以后，它就开始向岸边漂过来了。风正从海面上吹过来，船上张起了三角帆和前桅帆，渐渐地靠近了海岛。
慈悲河和“石窟”这两个阵地上的人隐藏得好好的，但是他们却隐藏不了激动的情绪。一旦在逼近眼前的敌船炮火面前暴露自己，他们就完全没法还手了。还有比这个更可怕的吗？怎样才能阻止海盗们登陆呢？
赛勒斯•史密斯充分感到这一点，他思忖着该怎么办。不久大家就要他作出决定了。但是，该怎样决定呢？仗着储藏的食品充足，躲在“花岗石宫”里，一连几个星期，甚至几个月地困守在那里吗？这样固然也好！但是以后怎么办呢？海盗们还会成为岛上的主人，他们会恣意蹂躏它，到了一定的时候，他们会用报复方法屠杀被围困在“花岗石窟”里的人。
不过，现在还有一个最后的机会：鲍勃•哈维也许不会冒险把船开到海峡里来，而只停留在小岛的外边。要是这样的话，他离海滨还有半英里，在这段距离以外，射击的威力是不会太大的。
“决不会！”潘克洛夫重复说，“假如鲍勃•哈维是一个航海老手，他决不会到海峡里来！他一定知道，当海水不高的时候，双桅船是会遇到危险的！丢了船以后，他该怎么办呢？”
这时候，双桅船已经靠近小岛了。可以看得出来，它正努力往下方开。风力很小，潮流的力量也大大地衰退了，鲍勃•哈维可以完全控制住他的船。
它循着小船走过的路线，对海峡进行侦察，并且大胆地往海峡里开进来。
现在海盗的企图非常明显：他打算把航侧炮火对着“石窟”，向打死同伴的开枪地点进行反击。
飞快号很快就来到了小岛的顶端，顺利地绕了过去．船上扯起主帆，抢着风，直向慈悲河口的对面驶来。
“该死的东西！他们来了！”潘克洛夫说。
这时候，纳布和吉丁•史佩莱回到赛勒斯•史密斯、艾尔通、水手和赫伯特这里来了。
通讯记者和他的同伴在撤退以前看出最好放弃慈悲河的阵地，因为在那里简直没法应付双桅船，于是他们就采取了这个聪明的举动。在面临着紧要关头的时候，移民们最好还是团结在一起。吉丁•史佩莱和纳布是从岩石后面躲躲闪闪地跑回来的，虽然引起了一阵射击，但是并没有打中他们。
“史佩莱！纳布！”工程师大声说，“你们没有受伤吗？”
“没有！”通讯记者答道，“仅仅是枪弹跳起来碰伤了点儿，那只该死的船已经开到海峡里来了！”
“是的，”潘克洛夫说，“十分钟内，它就要停在‘花岗石宫’的前面了！”
“你有什么计划吗，赛勒斯？”通讯记者问道。
“现在还来得及，我们只好躲到‘花岗石宫’里去了，罪犯们不会看见我们的。”
“我同意，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“不过，万一被围困起来……”
“到那时候我们再见机行事吧。”工程师说。
“那么，我们快走吧！”通讯记者说。
“史密斯先生，让艾尔通和我留在这里可以吗7”水手问道。
“这有什么用呢，潘克洛夫？”史密斯回答说。“不，我们不要分散！”
现在丝毫也不能浪费时间了。移民们离开了“石窟”。弯曲的山石遮挡着他们，因此双桅船上的人没有发现他们撤退。但是两三声枪响，和子弹打碎岩石的声音说明飞快号离他们已经不远了。
移民们跳进升降梯，上升到“花岗石宫”的门口，奔进大厅，前后仅仅用了一分钟。前一天晚上他们关在家里的托普和杰普还在里面呢。
他们回来得正是时候。居民们透过树枝可以看见飞快号在烟雾绦绕中开进了海峡。枪声不断地响着，四门大炮对着已经没有人占据的慈悲河阵地和“石窟”盲目地轰击。岩石被打成了碎片。每发一炮，海盗们都欢呼一阵。幸亏史密斯把窗户遮了起来，大家都希望“花岗石宫”或者能够幸免。但是，正在这时候，忽然有一颗炮弹，穿过屋门，打到走廊里来。
“我们被发现了！”潘克洛夫喊道。
也许移民们还没有被发现，但是有一点是肯定了：鲍勃•哈维认为这部分悬崖上所遮的枝叶有些可疑，因此就开了一炮。他立刻加强了进攻，第二炮打开了遮蔽着的树叶，花岗石壁上的洞隙暴露出来了。
移民们陷入绝境了。掩蔽所已经暴露出来。他们既不能阻挡猛烈的炮火，又不能够保护这片石壁——在炮火的轰击下，碎石在他们的周围横飞着。现在唯一的办法是到“花岗石宫”的上层甬道里去躲避。至于住房，只好让它破坏了。正在这时候，忽然传来一阵低沉的响声，接着就是一片凄惨的叫声。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的同伴们连忙向一个窗口奔去。
一股水柱猛不可当地把双桅船抛了起来，一下子把它冲成两爿，不到十秒钟的工夫，连船带人都沉到海中了！
Book 3 Chapter 4
"She has blown up!" cried Herbert.
"Yes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!" returned Pencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.
"But what has happened?" asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this unexpected catastrophe.
"Oh! this time, we shall know--" answered the engineer quickly.
"What shall we know?--"
"Later! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have been exterminated!"
And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined Pencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach.
Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been raised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in that position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as in that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it was certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low water.
A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft could be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their occupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the surface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of the wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the hull,-- which rendered the sudden disappearance of the "Speedy" perfectly inexplicable.
However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the shrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the others spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring up these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the islet. But just as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon Spilett arrested them.
"What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the Mercy?" said he.
In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone to pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.
They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It was probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel, they had fled into the interior of the island.
"We will deal with them later," said Harding. "As they are armed, they will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are equal. To the most pressing business first."
Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.
The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon but two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel.
Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of ropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the boat picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which were immediately carried to the Chimneys.
Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of Bob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some emotion,--
"That is what I have been, Pencroft."
"But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!" returned the sailor warmly.
It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were counted, which were already being carried by the current towards the open sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and the ship lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained below. Now the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men out to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in some corner of their island.
For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied in hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails which were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were absorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!
The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was a perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large number of useful articles. It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to the chest found at Flotsam Point.
"And besides," thought Pencroft, "why should it be impossible to refloat the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our 'Bonadventure'! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go anywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She would be well worth the trouble!"
In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists' chances of returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to decide this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide was quite low, so that every part of the brig's hull might be examined.
When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted for being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted, therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was talked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony.
"Miraculous is the word," repeated Pencroft, "for it must be acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment! Granite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!"
"And can you guess, Pencroft," asked the reporter, "how it happened, or what can have occasioned the explosion?"
"Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple," answered Pencroft. "A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are not sailors. Of course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!"
"Captain Harding," said Herbert, "what astonishes me is that the explosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and besides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the ship had rather foundered than blown up."
"Does that astonish you, my boy?" asked the engineer.
"Yes, captain."
"And it astonishes me also, Herbert," replied he, "but when we visit the hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter."
"Why, captain," said Pencroft, "you don't suppose that the 'Speedy' simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?"
"Why not," observed Neb, "if there are rocks in the channel?"
"Nonsense, Neb," answered Pencroft, "you did not look at the right moment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if she had only struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest vessel."
"It was just because she was not an honest vessel!" returned Neb.
"Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft," said the engineer.
"We shall soon see," rejoined the sailor, "but I would wager my head there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?"
Cyrus Harding did not answer.
"At any rate," said Gideon Spilett, "whether rock or explosion, you will agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!"
"Yes! yes!" replied the sailor, "but that is not the question. I ask Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this."
"I cannot say, Pencroft," said the engineer. "That is all the answer I can make."
A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to "an explosion," and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent to admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like the beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be an unknown rock.
And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is to say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks which would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not have been a collision. Therefore, the vessel had not struck. So she had blown up.
And it must be confessed that the sailor's arguments were reasonable.
Towards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the wreck. It was to be regretted that the brig's two boats had not been saved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the Mercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the brig went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been crushed.
The hull of the "Speedy" was just beginning to issue from the water. The brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken, pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the keel was visible along her whole length. She had been regularly turned over by the inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been at the same time manifested by an enormous water-spout.
The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the catastrophe, at least the effect produced.
Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from the beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn. Over a length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks, which would be impossible to stop up. Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the ribs, the iron bolts, and treenalls which united them. From the entire length of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with an unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several places, was split in all its length.
"I've a notion!" exclaimed Pencroft, "that this vessel will be difficult to get afloat again."
"It will be impossible," said Ayrton.
"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, "the explosion, if there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides! These great rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the explosion of a powder-magazine."
"There is not a rock in the channel!" answered the sailor. "I will admit anything you like, except the rock."
"Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig," said the engineer; "perhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her destruction."
This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to take an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their preservation.
Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still going down and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy masses of iron, had broken through in several places. The noise of the sea could be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull.
Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the shattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had been but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps uninjured.
They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The water would not return for several hours, and these hours must be employed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist up the barrels and chests. The boat received them and transported them to the shore. They took the articles as they came, intending to sort them afterwards.
At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that the brig possessed a very varied cargo--an assortment of all sorts of articles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools--such as the ships which make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with. It was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln Island.
However--and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment--not only, as has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the shock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the interior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows. Partitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had burst in the interior of the brig. The colonists could easily go fore and aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated. They were not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove, but simple packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer recognizable.
The colonists then reached the stern of the brig--the part formerly surmounted by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton's directions, they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus Harding thought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some barrels might be saved, and that the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal coverings might not have suffered from contact with the water.
This, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among a large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined with copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that the destruction of the "Speedy" could not be attributed to an explosion. That part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover, that which had suffered least.
"It may be so," said the obstinate sailor; "but as to a rock, there is not one in the channel!"
"Then, how did it happen?" asked Herbert.
"I don't know," answered Pencroft, "Captain Harding doesn't know, and nobody knows or ever will know!"
Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to flow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly as if moored by her anchors.
They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to resume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would not be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel.
It was now five o'clock in the evening. It had been a hard day's work for the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their fatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting the cases which composed the cargo of the "Speedy."
Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well received. There were enough to clothe a whole colony--linen for every one's use, shoes for every one's feet.
"We are too rich!" exclaimed Pencroft, "But what are we going to do with all this?"
And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms, balls of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter's, joiner's, and blacksmith's tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water. Ah, two years before, how these things would have been prized! And now, even though the industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools, these treasures would find their use.
There was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do also to forget that the six survivors of the "Speedy's" crew had landed on the island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the deepest dye, and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their guard against them. Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered desperate, these wretches would be capable of anything.
They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the meantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped up near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn during the night.
The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any attack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would have quickly given the alarm. The three following day--the 19th, 20th, and 21st of October--were employed in saving everything of value, or of any use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the brig. At low tide they overhauled the hold--at high tide they stowed away the rescued articles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the hull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the heavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft, diving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of the brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated by means of empty casks, were brought to shore.
It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the wreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always enthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of the river. With four guns, he engaged to prevent any fleet, "however powerful it might be," from venturing into the waters of Lincoln Island!
In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk, bad weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended to blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong gale from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his powder.
In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach.
As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he carefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover any trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that concerned either the captain or the owners of the "Speedy," and, as the name of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which would tell them her nationality. However, by the shape of her boats Ayrton and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build.
A week after the castrophe--or, rather, after the fortunate, though inexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation--nothing more could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had disappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had contained.
However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb, strolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder, bearing traces of explosion. The edges of this cylinder were twisted and broken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive substance.
Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied with his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.
Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to Pencroft,--
"You persist, my friend," said he, "in maintaining that the 'Speedy' was not lost in consequence of a collision?"
"Yes, captain," answered the sailor. "You know as well as I do that there are no rocks in the channel."
"But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?" said the engineer, showing the broken cylinder.
"What, that bit of pipe!" exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect incredulity.
"My friends," resumed Harding, "you remember that before she foundered the brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?"
"Yes, captain," replied Herbert.
"Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was this," said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.
"That?" returned Pencroft.
"Yes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!"
"A torpedo!" exclaimed the engineer's companions.
"And who put the torpedo there?" demanded Pencroft, who did not like to yield.
"All that I can tell you is, that it was not I," answered Cyrus Harding; "but it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable power!"
“船炸了！”赫伯特喊道。
“是的！就象艾尔通点着了火药似的，爆炸了！”潘克洛夫一面说，一面跟纳布和少年一起跳进升降梯。
“这是怎么一回事？”吉丁•史佩莱问道，这个意想不到的结局完全使他楞住了。
“嗯！这回我们可以知道了……”工程师很快地说。
“我们可以知道什么？……”
“别着急！别着急！来吧，史佩莱。主要的是，这些海盗都歼灭了，这是件大事！”
赛勒斯•史密斯催促着通讯记者和艾尔通赶到海滩去，和潘克洛夫、纳布、赫伯特会合在一起。
双桅船整个没有了，连它的桅杆也看不见。它被水柱抛起来，向侧边倒下去，然后就那样沉没了。毫无疑问，这是由于漏水漏的太厉害。可是这一带的海峡不过二十英尺深，可以肯定，在水浅的时候，沉船的船帮还会再露出水面来的。
沉船上的一些东西在水上漂浮着。一个木筏漂出仓口，慢慢地露到海面来，上面有储备着不用的圆材、养鸡的笼子——里面的鸡还活着——箱子和木桶；可是沉船的残骸却看不见，既没有甲板上的木料，也没有船身的肋材，飞快号的突然失踪简直不可思议。
可是船上的两根折断了的桅杆，终于摆脱护桅索和支索，漂了上来，它们上面还挂着帆，有的卷着，有的铺在水面。艾尔通和潘克洛夫不耐烦等潮水把财富带上来，就跳进小船，打算把沉船的残骸拖上海滩或是小岛。可是，正当他们要把小船摇开的时候，吉丁•史佩莱的一句话把他们拦住了。
“那六个在慈悲河右岸登陆的罪犯上哪里去了？”他说。
的确，千万马虎不得，虽然那六个人所乘的船巳经在岩石上撞得粉碎，然而他们却在遗物角登岸了。
居民们向那边望了一会。他们看不到一个亡命之徒。可能他们看见自己的船在海峡里沉没了以后，就逃到荒岛的内陆去了。
“我们将来再对付他们，”史密斯说。“他们还带着武器，遇见他们仍旧有危险，可是现在是六对六，双方的实力都是一样。还是先解决要紧的问题吧。”
艾尔通和潘克洛夫努力向沉船的地方划去。
海面非常平静，两天以前，才逢到新月，正是潮水较高的时候，至少还需要整整一个钟头，双桅船才能露出海峡的水面。
艾尔通和潘克洛夫用绳子缚住桅杆和圆材，把绳子的一端带到海滩上来。在居民们的共同努力之下，沉船的残骸被拉上来了。然后潘克洛夫和艾尔通又驾着小船，把漂浮的东西全捞了起来，其中有鸡笼、木桶和箱子，立刻送到“石窟”去。
水里也浮起几具尸体。艾尔通认出其中有鲍勃•哈维，就指着他，激动地对他的伙伴说：
“过去我也是干他这一行的，潘克洛夫。”
“可是现在你已经洗手不干了，勇敢的艾尔通！”水手热情地说。
浮起来的尸体很少，这的确很奇怪。他们数来数去，一共只有五六具，这些尸体，不久就被海流冲向大海去了。其余的极大部分罪犯很可能是来不及逃出来，船身倒在一边，都留在底下了。现在海流把这些倒楣的家伙的尸体冲出大海，倒免除了移民们一项伤心的任务——把它们埋葬在荒岛上。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们费了两个钟头的工夫，把圆材拖上沙滩来，然后又把船上的帆铺开，打算把它们晾干，这些帆丝毫没有损坏。他们一心一意地进行着工作，很少说话，然而他们脑子里却想得很多！
得到这只双桅船，换句话说，得到船上的一切物品，可以说是添了一笔巨大的财富。的确，一只船就好比是一个小世界，小队的仓库里可以增加许多有用的东西了。它等于在遗物角拾到的那只箱子，不过要更大一些。
“还有，”潘克洛夫心里想，“难道不能让双桅船重新浮起来吗？如果船底只有一个窟窿，那是可以修补好的；这只船有三四百吨重，和我们的乘风破浪号比起来，显得象样得多了！我们可以乘着它到遥远的地方去！我们爱上哪儿就上哪儿！史密斯先生，我一定要和艾尔通去仔细地看一下，在它身上费这一番气力是完全值得的！”
的确，如果双桅船还能航行，那么移民们回国的希望就要大得多了。可是，要决定这个重要的问题，必须等到退潮以后海水很低的时候，因为只有那时候，才能仔细检查整个的船身。
等到把财物安全地运上岸来以后，史密斯和他的伙伴们才同意用几分钟的时间吃早饭。他们都饿得很了，幸而离食品室不远，纳布又是一个厨师中的快手。于是他们就在“石窟”附近吃早饭；不用说就猜得出来，他们在吃饭的时候，谈的尽是小队意外脱离险境的奇迹。
“只能说是奇迹，”潘克洛夫一再说，“那些流氓被炸得真是时候！‘花岗石宫’正受到威胁！”
“你猜得出来吗，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者问道，“究竟是怎么回事，是什么东西引起爆炸的？”
“嗨！史佩莱先生，再简单也没有了，”潘克洛夫回答说，“犯人的船不象军舰上那样有纪律！犯人也不是水手。火药库一定是开着的，他们不停地开火，大概有哪个粗心大意或是笨手笨脚的人，一不留神就使全船爆炸了！”
“史密斯先生，”赫伯特说，“使我感到奇怪的是，爆炸并没有起什么更大的作用。爆炸的声音很小，并且炸坏的木板和肋材又不多。看起来它好家不是炸毁的，而是撞沉的。”
“你觉得这一点奇怪吗，孩子？”工程师问道。
“是的，史密斯先生。”
“我也觉得奇怪，赫伯特，”他说，“可是等我们检查过以后，一定会得到解答的。”
“怎么，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫说，“你难道认为飞快号是象触礁似的，撞沉下去的吗？”
“如果海峡里有礁石，”纳布说，“这有什么不可能呢？”
“胡说，纳布，”潘克洛夫说，“当时你没有看见。我可看得非常清楚，就在双桅船沉没以前的一刹那，一个大浪把它抛起来，然后它就往左边倒下去了。假如仅仅是触礁，它会象正常的船一样，安安静静地沉到海底去的。”
“就因为它不是一只正常的船！”纳布说。
“算了，我们很快就会知道的，潘克洛夫。”工程师说。
“我们很快就会知道的，”水手随着说，“不过我敢拿我的脑袋打赌，海峡里绝对没有岩石。史密斯先生，我们把话说清楚，你是不是觉得这件事情有些奇怪？”
赛勒斯•史密斯没有回答。
“触礁也好，爆炸也好，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“不管怎么样，潘克洛夫，你应该承认，这件事情正发生在紧要关头上！”
“是的！是的！”水手说，“可是问题不在那儿。我是问史密斯先生看出有什么神怪的地方没有。”
“我说不上来，潘克洛夫，”工程师说。“我只能这样回答你。”
这个回答完全不能使潘克洛夫满意。他一口咬定是“爆炸”，决不肯放弃这个想法。海峡底下铺着一层细沙，就跟沙滩一样，水浅的时候，他经常跨过海峡去，因此，他坚决不同意里面会有什么暗礁。
并且，双桅船沉下去的时候，水势很高，也就是说，即使落潮的时候有岩石露在水面，当时的水量也足够使任何船只浮起来，不致受到岩石的阻碍。因此，触礁是不可能的，船并没有受到撞击，可以肯定它是炸毁的。
必须承认，水手的论点并不是毫无根据。
将近一点半的时候，居民们登上小船去看沉船了。遗憾的是，没有能把双桅船上的两只小船保留下来：有一只已经交代过，在慈悲河口撞得粉碎，完全不能用了；另外一只是与双桅船的下沉同时失踪的，还没有重新露出来，一定也撞坏了。
这时候，飞快号的船身刚露出水面。双桅船歪倒在一边，这是由于它的桅杆全折断了，经过剧烈的震动，压仓的底货改变了位置，使全船失去重心的缘故；它的龙骨整个都能看见。当时海底有一种不可思议的惊人力量把它翻了过来，同时还出现了一股巨大的水柱。
居民们在船的周围划着，随着潮水的下退，他们即使不能证实失事的原因，至少也可以查明产生的后果。
靠近船头部分，离前梢七八英尺的地方，双桅船的龙骨两侧遭到严重的破坏。至少有二十英尺长的一段，两边各开着一个大缺口，要想把这样的窟窿堵住是不可能的。不仅没有了船底的铜包板和木板——毫无疑问，一定是炸成了灰烬——甚至用来连接它们的肋材、铁螺丝和木钉都不见了。一种莫名其妙的力量，使副龙骨和整个的船身从头到尾脱落了下来。龙骨的本身，从纵梁上裂开了好几处，已经完全折断了。
“我想，”潘克洛夫叫道，“这只船很难再浮起来了！”
“那是不可能的。”艾尔通说。
“那些先不说，”吉丁•史佩莱对水手说，“如果真是发生了爆炸，那么这个爆炸的结果也太奇怪了！它炸裂了船底，却没有炸坏甲板和楼顶！这些大窟窿根本不象火药库炸的，倒象是用石头砸的。”
“海峡里一块石头也没有！”水手说。“你说什么我都同意，就是不同意你说石头。”
“我们想法子到船里去吧，”工程师说，“也许进去以后，就可以知道它是怎样遭到破坏的了。”
这是最切实可行的办法，大家都同意了；并且，这样还能把全船的财物清点一下，作一个安排，收藏起来。
现在要进船很容易。潮水还在继续下退，甲板上已经可以走人了。压仓的底货是一些沉重的铁块，已经从几处漏到船壳外面来。海水从船身的窟窿里流出来，发出哗哗的响声。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们拿着斧头，沿着破碎的甲板往前走去。甲板上堆着各种箱子，拦住他们的去路，箱子在水里泡得不算久，也许里面的东西还没有损坏。
居民们忙着把所有的货物放到妥当的地方去。低潮的时候只有几小时，他们必须尽量利用这几个钟头。艾尔通和潘克洛夫在船身的入口处找到一些索具，可以用来把木桶和箱子吊起来。他们把货物装在小船里，运上岸去，马上又回来运各种物件，至于整理工作，打算以后再做。
总的来说，居民们非常满意，因为他们很快就发现双桅船上有着各种各样的货物。正象进行大规模沿海贸易的玻里尼西亚商船一样，它装载着五花八门的物件，器皿、工业品和工具，应有尽有。甚至他们无论要什么东西都能找到一些；大家一致认为这些东西正是林肯岛上的小队所迫切需要的。
然而，赛勒斯•史密斯却在发楞；不仅双桅船的船身遭到极大的损伤——这一点前面已经说过了，至于事故究竟怎样造成的姑且不谈——就连它的内部装置，特别是在靠船头的地方，也都毁坏了。好象曾经有什么极大的炮弹打到双桅船里来似的，隔板和支柱都遭到毁坏。移民们搬开箱子，就很容易从船头走到船尾去。这些箱子不是沉重的大件，而是普通的小件，因此并不难搬；箱子上标明起运地点的字迹，已经看不清了。
于是居民们来到双桅船的船尾，原来这里是舵楼甲板。根据艾尔通的指点，他们应该在这里找火药库。赛勒斯•史密斯认为火药库并没有爆炸，也许还能留下几桶火药，并且，火药通常是有金属封皮包装着的，大概不会受潮。
事实果然是这样。他们从子弹堆里找到二十桶火药，桶里都衬着铜皮。他们小心翼翼地把桶抬了出来。潘克洛夫亲眼看见以后，才相信飞快号不是被炸沉的，而且，火药库所在的这部分船身，所受的损失最小。
“也许不是炸沉的，”顽固的水手说，“可是要说石头，我敢肯定，海峡里一块也没有！”
“那么，事情是怎么发生的呢？”赫伯特问道。
“我不知道，”潘克洛夫回答说，“连史密斯先生都弄不清楚，那就谁也不明白了，而且再也不会有人能明白了！”
他们搜查了几个钟头，潮水开始上涨了。目前必须暂时停止工作。他们不必担心海水把船冲走，因为它已经象抛了锚似的，牢牢地固定在那里了。
因此，等到第二天再进行工作也没有问题；可是船虽然已经失事沉在那里，最好还是赶紧把船里的剩余物资收拾出来，因为它不久就要整个陷到海峡的流沙里去了。
这时候是傍晚五点钟。居民们忙了一天。他们的晚饭吃得津津有味，吃完以后，虽然非常疲倦，大家还是忍不住要把飞快号上的货箱打开来检查一下。
大部分箱子装着衣服，可以想象，它们受到大家一致欢迎。整个小队都够穿了——各种尺码的衣服和鞋子都有。
“我们太阔了！”潘克洛夫叫道。“可是我们怎么处理全部的东西呢？”
水手看见了烈性酒桶、烟叶桶、火器和刀剑、棉花包、耕作用具、木匠细木匠和铁匠的工具，还有许多盒各种各样的种籽，高兴得不住地欢呼，由于在水里的时间不长，这些东西丝毫也没有受潮。要是在两年以前得到这些东西，他们将要怎样的珍惜啊！不过，虽然勤劳的移民们现在已经有了工具，这些宝贝对他们还是有用的。
“花岗石宫”的仓库宽绰得很，可是要想在天黑以前把全部的东西都收拾干净，已经来不及了。并且，还不能忘记，飞快号的六个亡命之徒还在岛上，他们很可能是一群穷凶极恶的匪徒，移民们必须时刻提防他们。慈悲河上的桥都已经扯起来了，然而一条河流或小溪是拦不住这些罪犯的，在走投无路的时候，他们什么都干得出来。
他们不久就可以研究出最妥善的办法来，可是目前却只好在“石窟”附近站岗，因为箱笼物件就堆在那里。于是居民们在夜间轮流值班守卫着。
天亮了，罪犯们并没有来骚扰。杰普和托普守在“花岗石宫”脚下，如果有什么动静，它们会随时报警的。接着，10月19、20、21日，一连三天，他们都在忙着整理东西。不管货物也好，索具也好，每一样值钱的或是有用的东西都保留下来了。落潮的时候，他们检查船仓；涨潮的时候，就整理抢救出来的东西。船身的铜包板已经大部揭下来，船身一天天地往深处陷下去。可是，艾尔通和潘克洛夫不等流沙把从船底漏下去的沉重东西吞没，就潜入海峡的水底，把双桅船的锚链、压仓的铁块都捞上岸来，甚至还有四门炮，这些东西都是利用空桶把它们浮起来的。
很明显，小队的军火库和“花岗石宫”的仓库都由于沉船而充实起来了。潘克洛夫向来很热心订计划，这时候他已经开始盘算在海峡和慈悲河口的上面筑一个炮台了。他打算利用四门大炮，阻挡任何的舰队——“不管有多强大”——进犯林肯岛的领海！
等到双桅船上的东西全都运完，只剩下一个空壳的时候，天气变坏了，一下子就把它消灭得干干净净。赛勒斯•史密斯原来还打算把破船炸开，然后把岸上的残骸收拾一下；可是东北方吹来一阵狂风，加上狂潮一涨，工程师就只好节省些火药了。
23日到24日的夜里，整个的船身都碎散了，一部分残骸被抛到海滩上来。
至于船上的文件，不用说，尽管史密斯仔细搜索尾楼的橱柜，还是丝毫也没有发现。海盗们一定把与飞快号原来的船长和主人有关的标志全销毁了，船尾也没有漆着港口的名称，因此没法知道它的国籍。可是，根据它那两只小船的船型，艾尔通和潘克洛夫都认为这只双桅船是英国制造的。
出事以后的一星期——与其说出事，还不如说是奇妙的好运气，因为移民们就是这样才保全下来的——即使在水浅的时候，也看不见沉船了。船是消失了，但“花岗石宫”却由于接收了船上的全部财产而富裕起来。
然而，要不是由于纳布的缘故，这次神秘的爆炸一定永远也没法解释。10月30日，纳布在海滩上散步的时候，捡到一块铁筒的厚片，上面带有爆炸的痕迹。这块厚铁片的边缘扭得里进外出、残缺不全，样子好象是炸药的爆破搞成的。
纳布把铁片拿给他的主人，当时工程师正同伙伴们在“石窟”的工场里。
赛勒斯•史密斯仔细看了一下铁筒，然后转向潘克洛夫。
“朋友，”他说，“你坚持飞快号不是撞沉的，是吗？”
“是的，史密斯先生，”水手答道。“我们都知道，海峡里是没有礁石的。”
“可是，也许它是撞在这块铁片上的呢？”工程师一面说，一面把破铁筒给他看。
“什么，就这一小块破筒子！”潘克洛夫十分怀疑地叫道。
“朋友们，”史密斯接着说，“你们记得吗，在双桅船沉没以前，曾经有一个水柱把它抛起来？”
“记得，史密斯先生，”赫伯特答道。
“好，你们想知道水柱是怎么掀起来的吗？就是它。”工程师举着破筒子说。
“它？”潘克洛夫说。
“是的！这个铁筒就是水雷的残余！”
“水雷！”工程师的伙伴们都大叫起来。
“那么是谁布的水雷呢？”潘克洛夫问道，他还不能表示同意。
“我只能告诉你，不是我布的，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“可是水雷的残迹就在这儿，你们可以估计它的力量有多大！”
Book 3 Chapter 5
So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo. Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union, he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It was under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive substance, nitro- glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same nature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her. The "Speedy" had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!
Yes! all was explained, everything--except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel!
"My friends, then," said Cyrus Harding, "we can no longer be in doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps, abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so fortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine. What his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document, who placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the situation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We have contracted a debt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it."
"You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus," replied Gideon Spilett. "Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony. I will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication with us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the dugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements."
The reporter's reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.
"Yes," rejoined Cyrus Harding, "if the intervention of a human being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still, but if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The question, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your opinion on the matter?"
"My opinion," said Pencroft, "is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave man, and he has my esteem!"
"Be it so," answered Harding, "but that is not an answer, Pencroft."
"Master," then said Neb, "my idea is, that we may search as long as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall not discover him till he pleases."
"That's not bad, what you say, Neb," observed Pencroft.
"I am of Neb's opinion," said Gideon Spilett, "but that is no reason for not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him."
"And you, my boy, give us your opinion," said the engineer, turning to Herbert.
"Oh," cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, "how I should like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!"
"Of course, my boy," replied Pencroft, "so would I and all of us. I am not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual face to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong, with a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on clouds, a great ball in his hands!"
"But, Pencroft," answered Spilett, "you are describing a picture of the Creator."
"Possibly, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "but that is how I imagine him!"
"And you, Ayrton?" asked the engineer.
"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I can give you no better advice in this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you in your researches, I am ready to follow you.
"I thank you, Ayrton," answered Cyrus Harding, "but I should like a more direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important decision. Speak, therefore."
"Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, "I think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone. Perhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too, as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be only he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a man again. No, I will never forget him!"
"That is settled, then," said Cyrus Harding. "We will begin our researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island unexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses, and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions!"
For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work finished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there, methodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as much from animals as from man.
There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite. Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare utensils--in a word, all the stores of the colony.
As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of ordnance, which, at Pencroft's entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.
"Captain," said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, "now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried the range of our guns."
"Do you think that is useful?" asked the engineer.
"It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided?"
"Try them, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "However, I think that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which will never fail us."
"Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?" asked the reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite House.
"I believe so. However," added the engineer, "we will be prudent." The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make. Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be able to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range. In fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity.
"Now," said Harding to his companions, "the initial velocity is in proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent results."
"We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!" answered Pencroft.
It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order. Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States Navy.
On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony, including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried. They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.
Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.
At Harding's signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet, fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude.
The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear boy.
The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.
For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so as to try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its bursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord.
A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the colonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf.
"Well, captain," exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the reports themselves, "what do you say of our battery? All the pirates in the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not one can land there now without our permission!"
"Believe me, Pencroft," replied the engineer, "it would be better not to have to make the experiment."
"Well," said the sailor, "what ought to be done with regard to those six villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them to overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are regular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such! What do you think, Ayrton?" added Pencroft, turning to his companion.
Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that Pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved when Ayrton replied in a humble tone,--
"I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to speak."
And with a slow step he walked away.
Pencroft understood.
"What a brute I am!" he exclaimed. "Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to speak here as any one!"
"Yes," said Gideon Spilett, "but his reserve does him honor, and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past."
"Certainly, Mr. Spilett," answered the sailor, "and there is no fear of my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island of them as soon as possible."
"Is that your opinion, Pencroft?" asked the engineer.
"Quite my opinion."
"And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?"
"Isn't what they have done already enough?" asked Pencroft, who did not understand these scruples.
"They may adopt other sentiments!" said Harding, "and perhaps repent."
"They repent!" exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.
"Pencroft, think of Ayrton!" said Herbert, taking the sailor's hand. "He became an honest man again!"
Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had landed on the island with Bob Harvey's accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the "Speedy," and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.
"Come!" said be. "Everybody is against me! You wish to be generous to those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn't repent it!"
"What danger shall we run," said Herbert, "if we take care to be always on our guard?"
"Hum!" observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion. "They are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!"
"Why have they not done so?" said Herbert. "No doubt because it was not their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also."
"Well, well!" replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced. "Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don't think anything more about them!"
"Come, Pencroft," said Neb, "don't make yourself out so bad as all that! Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good range of your guns, you would not fire."
"I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb," replied Pencroft coldly.
"Pencroft," said the engineer, "you have always shown much deference to my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?"
"I will do as you please, Captain Harding," answered the sailor, who was not at all convinced.
"Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked first."
Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although Pencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but were to be on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile. If any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts, these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At any rate, for humanity's sake alone, it would be right to wait. The colonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without fear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their island. It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on their side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That remained to be seen.
于是，水雷在海底爆炸把一切疑问都解释清楚了。赛勒斯•史密斯是决不会错的，因为在南北战争中，他曾经试制过这种可怕的爆炸武器。这个铁筒里装着炸药——硝化甘油、苦味酸或其他类似的药品，就是在它的作用下，海峡里的潮水才掀成一个圆顶，船底才炸裂，以致立刻下沉，由于船身被破坏得非常严重，因此一沉下去就没法再浮起来了。装甲舰碰到这种水雷，也会象渔船似的毫不困难地被炸毁，飞快号碰上以后，当然更经受不起了！
是的！一切都真相大白了，现在只剩下一个问题——海峡里的水雷是怎么来的？
“因此，朋友们，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们现在不用再怀疑了，这里一定有一个神秘的人，也许和我们一样，他也是遇难以后，被遗弃在荒岛上的；我所以要这么说，是要让艾尔通也知道知道两年来我们所遇到的种种怪事。虽然我们有好几次得到他的帮助，我还是没法想象，这个陌生的恩人是谁。他屡次暗中帮助我们，究竟有什么目的，我也不知道。可是他确确实实是在帮助我们；并且根据性质来看，只有具备惊人才干的人，才能这样做。艾尔通和我们同样受到他的恩惠，因为当我从气球上掉下的时候，如果是他把我从海里救起来的；那么写那张纸条，把瓶子放在海峡里，让我们知道我们的伙伴所在的地方的，也一定就是这个陌生人。我还要补充一些事实：引着那只箱子，把它放在遗物角，使我们得到一切必需品的是他；在荒岛的高地上燃起篝火，使你们能够找到陆地的也是他，在西瑞身上打了一枪的是他；在海峡里布置水雷，炸毁双桅船的，也是他；一句话，所有那些我们不能解释的怪事，都是这个神秘的人做的。因此，不管他是谁，是遇难的人也好，是流放在我们岛上的人也好，我们都应该感激他；要不然，我们就成了忘恩负义的人了。我们欠下了这笔人情债，希望有一天我们能够还清它。”
“你说得对，亲爱的赛勒斯，”吉丁•史佩莱说。“不错，岛上藏着一个可以说是万能的人。他的力量对我们有莫大的好处。我还要补充一点，就是如果我们承认在实际生活中有超凡的事情，那么，这个陌生人的本领简直就近乎超凡入圣了。是不是他暗中从‘花岗石宫’的井里探听我们的消息，因此掌握了我们的全盘计划呢？是不是他在我们第一次试航的时候，把瓶子扔给我们的呢？是不是他把托普从湖里扔出来，刺死儒艮的呢？是不是他把你从海里救起来的呢？以当时发生这些事的情况来说，是谁也干不了的，这种种事实，使我们不由得要这样想：如果这些事情都是一个人干的。那么他简直有呼风唤雨的能力了。”
通讯记者的论点很正确，人人都有同感。
“是的，”赛勒斯•史密斯接着说，“如果可以肯定给我们解围的是一个人，我同意他具有一般人所没有的本领。现在这还是一个谜，可是如果能找到这个人，这个谜就可以解决了。因此，现在的问题是，我们究竟应该尊重这个仁慈的人，随他隐藏着不去惊动他，还是尽量把他找出来呢？你们对这个问题有什么意见？”
“我的意见是，”潘克洛夫说，“不管他是谁，他都是一个勇敢的人，我很佩服他！”
“话虽不错，”史密斯说，“可是我问的不是这个，潘克洛夫。”
“主人，”纳布说，“我的意见是，我们可以尽量找你说的那个人；可是我想，他如果不愿意露面，那我们是找不到他的。”
“你说得不错，纳布。”潘克洛夫说。
“我也同意纳布的意见，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是我们却不能因此就不探险了。不管我们能不能找到这个神秘的人。我们至少应该尽到找他的心意。”
“你呢，孩子，谈谈你的意见吧。”工程师对赫伯特说。
“呵，”赫伯特兴奋地说，“他先救了你，现在又救了我们大家，我真想谢谢他！”
“当然，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“我们每一个人都想谢他。我向来是不爱追根问底的，可是要能够面对面看他一眼，挖我一只眼睛我也甘心情愿！我想这个人一定长得很英俊，高高的个子，身体魁梧，留着漂亮的胡子，亮光光的头发；还有，他一定是坐在云彩上，手里托着一个大地球！”
“潘克洛夫，”史佩莱说，“你说的是全能的造物主的形象呀。”
“也许是的，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“不过，我想象中他就是那样的！”
“你呢，艾尔通？”工程师问道。
“史密斯先生，”艾尔通回答说，“在这个问题上我想不出更好的意见了。你所采取的办法就是最好的办法。如果你要我和你们一起去搜查的话，我随时都准备跟你们去。”
“谢谢你，艾尔通，”赛勒斯•史密斯答道，“可是我希望你能回答我的问题，怎么想的就怎么说。你是我们的伙伴，你已经为我们冒过好几次生命危险了。我们在作出任何一项重要决定的时候，都应该和其他人一样，也和你商量。所以，你还是说说你的意见吧。”
“史密斯先生，”艾尔通说，“我认为我们应该尽一切力量把这个陌生的恩人找出来。也许他是孤单单的一个人。也许他在受着苦难。也许他需要换一种新的生活。你们说得对，我也应该还他的人情。一定是他，而且只能是他曾经到达抱岛去过，他在那里发现了你们知道的那个可怜人，并且让你们知道，有一个不幸的人在那里等待着你们去援救！因此，多亏了他，我才重新变成人。不能，我永远也不能忘记他！”
“那么，就这样决定了，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“我们要尽早开始搜查。这一次对于荒岛的任何一个角落都不能放过。我们连最隐蔽的地方也要搜索，希望这位陌生的朋友能考虑到我们的用意，原谅我们！”
几天以来，移民们积极地整理干草，进行田间收割。他们打算先把一切能做完的工作尽量做好，然后再去实现他们的计划——探索荒岛上还没有到过的地方。从达抱岛移植过来的各种蔬菜，现在也到了该收获的时候。一切都收拾好了，好在“花岗石宫”里有的是地方，把岛上的全部物资运来都装得下。小队收获下来的东西井井有条地藏在那里。可以想象，存放的地方非常安全，既不怕动物糟蹋，又不怕歹人劫掠。
隔着厚实的花岗石壁，完全不必担心受潮。居民们利用鹤嘴锄和火药，把上甬道的许多天然石洞都扩大了，因此，“花岗石宫”成了一个综合仓库，里面放着全部的粮食、武器、工具和不用的器皿——一句话，整个小队的物资全放在里面了。
从双桅船上得来的炮是优良的武器，在潘克洛夫的要求下，终于用绳索和辘轳把它们吊到“花岗石宫”里来。他们在窗洞之间凿了几个炮眼，不久以后，就可以在花岗石壁上看见光亮的炮口了。他们在这么高的地方，可以俯瞰整个的联合湾。这里好比是一个小小的直布罗陀，任何船舶，只要在小岛附近抛锚，就一定要暴露在这座高空炮台的射程之内。
“史密斯先生，”11月8日那天，潘克洛夫说，“现在我们的炮台已经筑好了，不妨试试大炮的射程。”
“你认为这样做有用吗？”工程师问道。
“不但有用，而且有必要！要不然，怎么知道我们那些刮刮叫的炮弹能射多远呢？”
“试吧，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道。“可是，我想还是把普通火药原封不动地留着不要用，在试验的时候用棉花火药，因为棉花火药是用不完的。”
“大炮经得住棉花火药的爆炸吗？”通讯记者问道，他也和潘克洛夫一样，急于试一试“花岗石宫”里的大炮。
“我想是经得住的。”工程师说，“但我们应该谨慎一些。”
工程师想得不错，大炮钢质十分优良。这是用锻钢铸造的一种后膛炮，按理可以装填大量的火药，射得很远。事实上，要想取得实际效果，弹道就必须尽量低伸，而要想得到这种力量，就必须有极大的初速，推动炮弹前进。
“初速跟火药的多少是成正比的。”史密斯对伙伴们说，“在制造这种大炮的时候，一切都要由所用的金属是不是具有最高度的抵抗力来决定，钢，无疑的是抵抗力最大的金属。因此，我完全有理由相信，我们的炮可以安全地经受爆炸气体的膨胀，试射效果肯定是良好的。”
“等我们试过以后，就更可以肯定了！”潘克洛夫说。
不用说，四门大炮收拾得就跟新的一样。自从打水里捞起来以后，水手在它们身上花了不少气力。他用了许多时间去磨光、上油、擦亮和拆洗零件！现在它们亮得和美国海军巡洋舰上的大炮一样。
于是，这一天，四门大炮就在全体居民——包括杰普和托普——面前按次序试放了。前面已经说过，棉花火药的爆炸威力相当于普通火药的四倍，他们考虑到这一点，然后给大炮装上适当量的棉花火药。炮弹是圆锥筒形的。
潘克洛夫站在那里，抓住拉火绳的末端，随时准备发射。
史密斯把手一挥，他就开炮了。炮弹飞过小岛，一直掉在海里，距离没法精确估计。
第二炮瞄准遗物角尽头的岩石，炮弹打在一块离“花岗石宫”几乎有三英里的尖石头上，炸得碎石乱飞。这一炮是赫伯特瞄准了发射的，他对自己的第一炮感到非常骄傲。可是潘克洛夫却比他还要骄傲得多！因为这一炮打得这么漂亮，而荣誉又属于他亲爱的孩子。
第三炮对着联合湾南边的沙丘，一炮射去，打在四英里以外的沙地上，然后炮弹又蹦起来落在海里，溅起一片水花。
在放第四炮的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯稍微多加了一些火药，打算看看最多能射多远。由于怕发生爆炸，大家都站得很远，然后用一根长绳子拉火。
一声惊人的巨响过后，移民们立刻跑到窗口去，大炮的效果很好，只见炮弹在离“花岗石宫”将近五英里的颚骨角擦过岩石．掉在鲨鱼湾里了。
“好哇，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫叫道，他的欢呼声简直和炮声不相上下，“你看我们的炮台怎么样？太平洋上的海盗全到‘花岗石宫’前面来都不要紧！如果没有得到我们许可，谁也不要想登陆！”
“信不信由你，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“这样的试验还是不做的好。”
“嗯？”水手说，“那么应该怎样对付还在岛上游荡的那六个坏蛋呢？难道让他们糟蹋我们的森林、田地和农场吗？这些强盗是不折不扣的美洲豹，我认为我们必须毫不犹豫地用炮火对付他们！你说呢，艾尔通？”潘克洛夫对他的伙伴说。
艾尔通犹豫了一下，没有立刻回答，赛勒斯•史密斯对潘克洛夫冒冒失失地提出这个问题感到非常遗憾。尤其使他感动的是，艾尔通竟这样自卑地说：
“我也曾经是一只美洲豹，潘克洛夫先生。我没有权利发言。”
于是他慢慢地走开了。
潘克洛夫这才明白过来。
“我真不是个人！”他大声说。“可怜的艾尔通！在这里，他和大家一样，有他的发言权！”
“是的，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是他愈沉默，我们愈应该看重他，我们应该尊重他追悔往事的心情。”
“当然，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“你不必操心，我再也不会这样做了。我宁可咬掉自己的舌头，也不愿意使艾尔通伤心！现在把话说回来。我觉得对待那些强盗就应该老实不客气，我们必须赶快把他们从岛上消灭掉。”
“这是你的意见吗，潘克洛夫？”工程师问道。
“一点儿也不错。”
“在他们对我们还没有什么新的敌对行动以前，你就打算毫不留清地去追捕他们吗？”
“他们已经做的难道还不够吗？”潘克洛夫问道，他不懂得仔细考虑。
“也许他们会改变心情的！”史密斯说，“也许他们会悔过。”
“他们会海过！”水手耸耸肩叫道。
“潘克洛夫，你想想艾尔通吧！”赫伯特拉着水手的手说。“他已经改邪归正了！”
潘克洛夫挨着个地看着他的伙伴。他万万没有想到他的意见会遭到反对。这些流氓是跟鲍勃•哈维的狐群狗党一起到岛上来的。他们是屠杀飞快号全体船员的凶手；潘克洛夫把他们看作是一群野兽，必须毫不迟疑毫不留情地把他们消灭掉；他秉性直率，因此认为不能和这帮人打交道。
“好吧！”他说。“人人都反对我！你们打算饶了这帮匪徒！很好，但愿我们没有后悔的时候！”
“只要我们随时警惕，”赫伯特说，“有什么危险呢？”
“哼！”通讯记者说，他还没有表明过自己的主张。“他们是六个全副武装的人。要是各自躲在一个角落里，向我们每人放一枪，他们马上就可以成为岛上的主人了！”
“他们为什么没有这样做呢？”赫伯特说。“因为他们不打算这样做，这是很明显的。再说，我们也是六个人。”
“好吧，好吧！”潘克洛夫说，他是没有法子说服的。“让这些好人爱干什么就干什么去吧，也不必去为他们操心了！”
“潘克洛夫，”纳布说，“不要让你自己当恶人！要是有一个不幸的人站在你的面前，在你的射程之内，你也不会开枪的。”
“我会象打疯狗似的一枪把他打死，纳布。”潘克洛夫冷冷地说。
“潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“你一向是听我话的；在这个问题上，你能听我的话吗？”
“我可以按照你的意思去做，史密斯先生。”水手说，可是他丝毫也没有改变他的看法。
“很好，那么，除非他们先向我们进攻，要不然我们决不攻击他们。”
虽然潘克洛夫算计着这样做完全没有好处、可是大家就这样通过对海盗采取的行动了。他们不打算进攻，只准备防守。荒岛地面很大，而且土地肥沃。如果这些坏人还有一些良心，他们就可能改邪归正。他们不想在这种环境里开始新生吗？不管怎么样，根据人道主义的要求，这样等待他们还是必要的。移民们不能象以前那样毫无顾虑地走来走去了。以前只要提防野兽就行了，现在却有六个罪犯出没在荒岛上，也许他们还是一些极坏的人。情况的确是严重的。而且对胆子小一些的人来说，等于失去了安全的保障！当然，目前移民们有理由反对潘克洛夫的看法，可以认为不要紧。将来这种看法是不是对呢？只好等以后再证实了。
Book 3 Chapter 6
However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would have two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was now indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished to set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days duration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One of the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present, and a few days' rest was necessary. The departure was, therefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November. The month of November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the northern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering the tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time was, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which, if it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since Harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.
During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that the work on Prospect Heights should be finished off.
Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the domesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally supplied the stables.
As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than formerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough for the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.
Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager, and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all in order at the corral.
During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project which would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which was already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite beneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls River.
The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by means of well-cemented blocks of stone.
This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the overflow of the lake formerly escaped.
Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not fail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise.
This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was very anxious to know if the little creek in which the "Bonadventure" was moored, had been visited by the convicts.
"These gentlemen," he observed, "landed on the south coast, and if they followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn't give half-a-dollar for our 'Bonadventure.'"
Pencroft's apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit to Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his companions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed. Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one who approached too near him, whether "man or beast," as he said. Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o'clock all three left Granite House.
Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had crossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should announce the colonists' return, and that at the signal Neb should return and reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river.
The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the southern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles and a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to traverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest, as well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no doubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the means of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less accessible parts of the island.
Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the "Bonadventure" was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However, Port Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the sea.
"Come," said Pencroft, "the blackguards have not been there yet. Long grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far West."
"And it's very lucky, for if they had found the 'Bonadventure'," added Herbert, "they would have gone off in her, and we should have been prevented from returning to Tabor Island."
"Indeed," remarked the reporter, "it will be important to take a document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island, and Ayrton's new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch him."
"Well, the 'Bonadventure' is always there, Mr. Spilett," answered the sailor. "She and her crew are ready to start at a moment's notice!"
"I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our exploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the stranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island as about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author of the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the return of the yacht!"
"But!" exclaimed Pencroft, "who in the world can he be? The fellow knows us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should he conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of honest men isn't unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily? Can he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain any longer?"
Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and looked about the deck of the "Bonadventure." All at once, the sailor having examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was secured,--
"Hallo," he cried, "this is queer!"
"What is the matter, Pencroft?" asked the reporter.
"The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!"
And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.
"What, it was not you?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running bowline."
"You must be mistaken, Pencroft."
"I am not mistaken!" declared the sailor. "My hand does it so naturally, and one's hand is never mistaken!"
"Then can the convicts have been on board?" asked Herbert.
"I know nothing about that," answered Pencroft, "but what is certain, is that some one has weighed the 'Bonadventure's' anchor and dropped it again! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat that some one has been using our vessel!"
"But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather gone off with her."
"Gone off! where to--to Tabor Island?" replied Pencroft. "Do you think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?"
"We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet," rejoined the reporter.
"However that may be," said the sailor, "as sure as my name is Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our 'Bonadventure' has sailed without us!"
The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could dispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the sailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised and then dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers, unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?
"But how was it we did not see the 'Bonadventure' pass in the sight of the island?" observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every possible objection.
"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "they would only have to start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the island in two hours."
"Well," resumed Gideon Spilett, "I ask again, what object could the convicts have had in using the 'Bonadventure,' and why, after they had made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?"
"Why, Mr. Spilett," replied the sailor, "we must put that among the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief thing is that the 'Bonadventure' was there, and she is there now. Only, unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very likely not find her again in her place!"
"Then, Pencroft," said Herbert, "would it not be wisest to bring the 'Bonadventure' off to Granite House?"
"Yes and no," answered Pencroft, "or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there."
"But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?"
"Perhaps yes," replied Pencroft. "At any rate, since we must leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the 'Bonadventure' will be safer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these blackguards."
"That is exactly my opinion," said the reporter. "At any rate in the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at the mouth of the Mercy."
"But suppose the convicts pay her another visit," said Herbert.
"Well, my boy," replied Pencroft, "not finding her here, they would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore, with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our return we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant visits."
"That's settled. Let us be off," said the reporter.
Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House, told the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their arrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the "Bonadventure" would be always within reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.
That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish the engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided that on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself.
But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was, therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate reply.
The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.
The colonists' uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control over his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night?
They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.
"But," said Herbert, "perhaps some accident has happened to the telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?"
"That may be," said the reporter.
"Wait till to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding. "It is possible, indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not received his."
They waited, of course not without some anxiety.
At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric current along the wire and received no reply.
He tried again: the same result.
"Off to the corral," said he.
"And well armed!" added Pencroft.
It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone and that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends to Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he watched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton.
In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to force the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them, and as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where, the lift once raised, he would be in safety.
Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair to the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring woods.
At six o'clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions had passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound crowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.
The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights, immediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns, ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and the two guns had been loaded with ball.
The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really formidable.
The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them, sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger.
Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which connected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty. The posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped, exclaiming,--
"The wire is broken!"
His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident that the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite House.
"It wasn't the wind that blew down this post," observed Pencroft.
"No," replied Gideon Spilett. "The earth has been dug up round its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man."
"Besides, the wire is broken," added Herbert, showing that the wire had been snapped.
"Is the fracture recent?" asked Harding.
"Yes," answered Herbert, "it has certainly been done quite lately."
"To the corral! to the corral!" exclaimed the sailor.
The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral, having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with redoubled speed.
Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in the corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this communication?
The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were sincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?
Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows of the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their guns were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every side. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous.
At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage could be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the corral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton's voice could be heard.
"Let us enter," said Cyrus Harding.
And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment's notice.
Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it back, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a cry of pain.
Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.
移民们的头一件大事是彻底搜索全岛，这一点已经决定了。搜索的目的有两个：一方面要找出那个神秘的人，因为现在已经可以肯定岛上有这样一个人；另一方面，还要了解海盗的情况，他们藏在哪里，目前在过着什么样的生活，他们有哪些可怕的地方。赛勒斯•史密斯本打算毫不耽搁，立刻就出发，可是探险需要用几天的工夫，最好还是把各种必需品和工具装在车上，以便组织露宿。偏巧有一只野驴伤了腿，暂时不能拉车，必须让它休息几天。因此，只好把动身的日子订在11月20日，往后推迟一星期。这个地方的十一月相当于北半球的五月，因此正是大好风光。太阳进入了南回归线，目前是一年里白天最长的时候。所以，要去探险，现在是最适合的时候，即使探险的主要目的不能达到，至少也可以有得多的发现，特别是自然物产方面的发现；因为史密斯建议要探索的是一直绵延到盘蛇半岛尽头的远西森林。
大家一致同意，利用出发前的九天，做完眺望岗上的工作。
此外，还需要艾尔通回畜栏去照料家畜。大家决定让他在那里住两天，等把厩房里的饲料准备充足以后，再回“花岗石宫”来。
艾尔通临动身的时候，史密斯考虑到岛上不象过去那样安全了，就问他要不要有一个人陪他一起去。艾尔通回说不必，因为工作一个人满可以照顾得过来，至于有什么危险，他是不怕的。如果畜栏或是附近发生什么事情，他可以立刻打电报告诉“花岗石宫”里的居民。
9日清晨，天一亮艾尔通就出发；他驾着一只野驴，拉着大车走了。两个钟头以后，来了一个电报，告诉大家畜栏里平安无事。
在这两天中，史密斯忙着办一件事，这件事办好以后，“花岗石宫”就不怕任何突如其来的袭击了。格兰特湖南端原有的缺口早已堵死了，而且已经被长出的草木遮住了一部分，现在必须把它完全挡起来。进行这项工作，再容易也没有了，只要使湖水升高两三英尺，就可以把洞口完全淹没。要提高湖面，只要在湖的两个缺口处各建一个水闸，因为湖水就是通过这两个缺口流入甘油河与瀑布河的。
移民们满怀信心地工作着，这两个水闸宽不过八英尺，高不过三英尺，他们把石块严密地垒起来，不久就把水闸砌成了。
这项工程完毕以后，外人做梦也想不到这部分湖底下有一条通道，想不到过去湖水就是从这里流出去的。
当然，供应“花岗石宫”蓄水池用水和带动升降梯的小河还小心地保留着，而且，保证不会断水。这样，只要把升降梯吊起来，这个可靠的安乐窝就万无一失了。
这项工程完成得很快，潘克洛夫、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特还可以抽出时间到气球港去一次。水手非常着急，他总担心罪犯们已经到停泊乘风破浪号的小海湾那里去过了。
“这些先生们是在南岸登陆的，”他说，“要是他们沿着海滨前进，也许会发现小港。那时候，我们的乘风破浪号就等于白扔了。”
潘克洛夫的顾虑并不是毫无根据的。看起来，气球港的确需要去看一下。11月10日，吃完午饭以后，水手和他的伙伴们带着武器出发了。潘克洛夫故意当着大家的面，把两颗子弹分别装进他的步枪的两个枪筒里，一面摇摇头，他那副样子好象在说，不管是谁——正如他自己所说的，“人也好，畜生也好，”——只要走到他面前，就都要倒楣了。吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特也拿着枪，大约三点钟的时候，三个人离开了“花岗石宫”。
纳布把他们送到慈悲河拐角的地方，等他们过了河以后，就把桥扯起来了。他们约定在回来的时候，放枪为号，纳布听见枪声，就来恢复两岸之间的交通。
他们沿着通向荒岛南岸的道路，一直往前走去，这一段距离只有三英里半，可是吉丁•史佩莱和他的伙伴却走了两个钟头。他们仔细地观察了沿路各处，浓密的森林，潦凫沼地，然而并没有发现亡命之徒的踪迹；毫无疑问，罪犯们还不知道移民的人数和已经采取的防御手段，因此只占了荒岛一小部分。
到了气球港，只见乘风破浪号静静地浮在小海湾上，潘克洛夫非常高兴。气球港周围有高耸的峭壁遮挡着，地势险峻，不管是在陆地上还是在海里，都很不容易发现它。
“快来吧，”潘克洛夫说，“那些坏蛋还没有到这儿来过。俗语说得好：‘深山有虎豹’，他们一定藏到远西森林里去了。”
“还好，”赫伯特说，“要是他们找到乘风破浪号，他们一定会乘着它逃跑的——那么一来，我们就不能再到达抱岛去了。”
“真的，”通讯记者说，“我们应该送一张纸条到那里去。要是苏格兰游船来接艾尔通回去的话，就能知道林肯岛的位置和艾尔通的新住址了。”
“嗯，乘风破浪号随时都在这儿准备着，史佩莱先生，”水手说。“我们马上乘着它动身都可以！”
“我想，潘克洛夫，那要等我们在荒岛上探索完毕以后再去。如果我们能找到那个陌生人就好了，也许他了解达抱岛和了解林肯岛一样清楚。不要忘记，那张纸条一定是他写的；也许，连究竟能不能指望游船回来，他都知道！”
“可是，”潘克洛夫大声说，“他究竟是谁啊？他这样了解我们，而我们却一点也不了解他！如果他只不过是个遇难的人，那么他为什么要隐藏着不出来呢？我们是老实人，我想老实人总不会被人讨厌的。他是自己要到这儿来的吗？如果他想离开这儿，他能离开吗？他还在这儿吗？他还要继续呆下去吗？”
潘克洛夫、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特一面闲谈，一面走上乘风破浪号去察看船上的甲板。水手看了一下系锚缆的短桩，突然叫道：
“嘿，真奇怪！”
“怎么回事，潘克洛夫？”通讯记者问道。
“是这么回事，这个扣不是我系的！”
潘克洛夫指着一根把锚缆系在短桩上的绳子。
“什么，不是你系的？”吉丁•史佩菜问道。
“不是！我可以发誓，这是一个拱结，我总是打活扣的。”
“你一定记错了，潘克洛夫。”
“我决没有记错！”水手声明说。“我的手系起扣来成了习惯了，一个人的手总不会错的！”
“那么，是不是罪犯们到船上来过了呢？”赫伯特问道。
“那我就不知道了，”潘克洛夫说，“反正有人拔过乘风破浪号的锚，然后又让它抛锚，这是可以肯定的！瞧，这儿又是一个证据！锚缆被抽了出来，卷索不在锚缆孔里了。我再重复一遍，有人用过我们的船了！”
“可是，如果罪犯们发现了它，他们一定会把它抢去使用，甚至还会乘着它逃跑的。”
“逃跑！跑到哪儿去……到达抱岛去吗？”潘克洛夫问道。“这只船这么小，你想他们敢乘着它去冒险吗？”
“再说，他们还不一定知道有那个小岛呢。”通讯记者接着说。
“不管怎么样，”水手说，“就好象我生在葡萄园、名叫潘克洛夫一样的没有错，我们的乘风破浪号已经偷偷地出去航行过了！”
水手非常肯定，吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特都感到没法辨驳。自从潘克洛夫把这只船带到气球港来以后，显然有人或多或少移动过它了。水手更是百分之百地认为曾经有人拔过锚，然后又把锚抛下去。这样往返两道手续，除非是为了用它航行，此外还能有什么别的企图呢？
“可是我们在岛上怎么没有看见乘风破浪号在海里走过呢？”通讯记者说，他急于把所有的反对意见一下子都提出来。
“怎么，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“只要在夜里遇着顺风，两个钟头以内，它就可以走到海岛的视线以外去了。”
“好吧，”吉丁•史佩莱接着问道，“我还要问一个问题，罪犯们驾驶乘风破浪号去做什么，而且用过以后，为什么又要把它送回港口来？”
“嗯，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“这点我们不必多费脑筋，只好把它列入那些不可思议的事情里去。主要的问题是乘风破浪号还在这儿，而且现在就在这儿。要是不幸让罪犯们第二次把它劫走，恐怕我们就不用打算再在这里找到它了！”
“那么，潘克洛夫，”赫伯特说，“我们把乘风破浪号带回去，让它停在‘花岗石宫’附近不好吗？”
“也好也不好，”潘克洛夫答道，“还是不好的成分居多。慈悲河口一点不适合停船，那里的潮势太猛。”
“可是能不能把它停在‘石窟’底下的沙滩上呢？”
“也许可以，”潘克洛夫回答说。“不管怎么样，既然我们一定要离开‘花岗石宫’作一次远征，我想，当我们不在的时候，还是把乘风破浪号留在这儿比较安全些，在岛上的匪徒没有肃清以前，我们最好还是把它放在这里。”
“我完全同意，”通讯记者说。“如果遇到变天，这里至少不会象在慈悲河口那样，暴露在外面。”
“可是如果罪犯们再上这儿来呢？”赫伯特说。
“孩子，”潘克洛夫回答说，“他们即使在这里找不到它，也会很快就在‘花岗石宫’的沙滩上找到它的！反正当我们不在的时候，没有任何办法能拦阻他们把船抢走！因此，我同意史佩莱先生的意见，还是把它留在气球港。不过，如果等我们回来以后，还不能肃清这帮流氓的话，那时候我们就要谨慎些，把船放到‘花岗石宫’附近去，等到不怕再有什么讨厌的骚扰的时候，再另作打算。”
“对，就这样决定了。我们走吧！”通讯记者说。
潘克洛夫、赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱回到“花岗石宫”以后，把全部经过都告诉了工程师，工程师对他们目前的办法和将来的打算，都表示同意。他还答应水手，要勘探一下小岛和海岸之间的海峡，看看能不能利用水闸，在那里开辟一个人工的港口。要是能够办到，那么，乘风破浪号就将永远摆在移民们的眼前，随时可以照管它了；甚至在必要的时候，还可以把它锁起来。
当天晚上，他们打了一个电报给艾尔通，要求他从畜栏带两只山羊来，因为纳布想使它们适应高地的水土。奇怪的是，这次与平时不同，在电报发出后，艾尔通并没有回电。工程师不禁诧异起来。但是也可能当时艾尔通不在畜栏里，甚至他已经动身回“花岗石宫”了。事实上他到畜栏去已经有两天，临行预先约定在10日晚上，至迟在11日早上回来。于是移民们在眺望岗上等待着艾尔通。纳布和赫伯特甚至一直迎到桥边，打算一看见他们的伙伴，就放下吊桥。
可是直到晚上十点钟，还是没有艾尔通的信号。于是，大家主张最好再打一个电报，要求对方立刻回答。
然而，“花岗石宫”的电报铃还是没有响声。
居民们非常不安。出了什么事了？是艾尔通已经不在畜栏里，还是他依然在那里，但是不能自由行动了呢？他们可以在这茫茫的黑夜里到畜栏去吗？
大家商量了一下。有的主张去，有的主张不去。
“可是，”赫伯特说，“也许是电报发生了故障，通报不灵了吧？”
“那也可能。”通讯记者说。
“等到明天吧，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“的确，艾尔通可能收不到我们的电报，我们也可能收不到他的。”
他们等待着，自然，他们的心情是非常焦急的。
第二天，11月11日，大亮的时候，史密斯又打了一次电报，还是没有回音。
他接着又试了一次，结果还是一样。
“到畜栏去！”他说。
“全副武装！”潘克洛夫补充道。
大家马上想到，“花岗石宫”里不能不留人，决定让纳布看家。纳布把伙伴们送到甘油河畔，把吊桥扯起来，然后躲在一棵树后面，等待他们或是艾尔通回来。
要是海盗们突然出现，要夺路过来，纳布可以开枪阻止他们，万一阻挡不住，最后还能躲到“花岗石宫”去，只要把升降梯一吊起来，他就可以安如磐石了。
赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫四个人到畜栏去，如果找不到艾尔通，他们就到附近的森林里去搜索。
早上六点钟，工程师和他的三个伙伴跨过甘油河，纳布藏在左岸的一个顶上长满龙血树的小丘后面。
居民们离开眺望岗的高地，径直走上畜栏路。他们扛着枪，哪怕遇到最小的敌对行动，都随时准备开枪。两支步枪和两支滑膛枪都已装满了子弹。
路的两旁都是密林，罪犯们到处都可以藏身，加上他们还有武器，敌人的确是可怕的。
移民们走得很快，一路上一句话也没有说。托普在前面引着路，有时候一路奔跑，有时候钻到森林里去，可是始终保持安静，好象没有遇到什么意外。他们相信这只忠实的狗是不会使他们突然受到惊吓的，只要稍微有一些危险，它就会大叫起来。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们继续前进，路旁就是从“花岗石宫”通往畜栏的电报线。走了将近两英里，他们还没有发现任何可以解释疑问的地方。电报杆好好的竖在地上，电线也照常拉着。可是，这时候工程师发现电线好象松了，一路领先的赫伯特走到第七十四号电线杆的时候，突然停下来喊道：
“电线断了！”
伙伴们连忙赶上前去，来到少年站脚的地方。只见电线杆横倒在路上，连根拔起来了。疑问突然得到了解答，显然，“花岗石宫”和畜栏两处打出的电报都没有收到。
“这根电线杆不象是被风刮倒的。”潘克洛夫说。
“不错，”吉丁•史佩莱说。“齐根的土都被挖起来了，这是人们用手拔起来的。”
“还有，电线也断了。”赫伯特指着断线补充道。
“是最近破坏的吗？”史密斯问道。
“是的，”赫伯特回答说，“肯定是不久以前才破坏的。”
“到畜栏去！到畜栏去！”水手大叫道。
居民们现在所在的地方正是“花岗石宫”和畜栏的中间，还要走二英里半。他们加快了速度，急急在前赶去。
的确，可能畜栏里出了什么事了。固然艾尔通打出的电报可能没有收到，但是他的伙伴们考虑的却不是这个。更使人难以理解的是：艾尔通答应在前一天晚上回来，结果却没有回来。一句话，切断“花岗石宫”和畜栏之间的联系不会是没有用意的，而这个破坏联系的人除了那些罪犯以外，还有谁呢？
居民们急急忙忙地向前赶去，每个人心里都感到十分焦急。他们衷心地喜爱这位新来的伙伴。他们会不会发现他被从前的党羽亲手杀害了呢？
他们不久就来到一处地方，这里路旁有一条小河，河水是从红河里流出来的，它成了畜栏牧场的水源。这时他们脚步慢下来了，为的是免得在必须战斗的时候，喘不过气来。他们的手指都扣着枪的板机。大家注视着四面的森林。托普阴沉沉地咆哮着，似乎预告有什么不幸的事情要发生了。
终于，从树木中间露出了畜栏的栅栏。看不见有什么破坏的痕迹。大门还是照常关着。畜栏里静悄悄的，既听不见平日咩咩的羊叫，也听不见艾尔通的吆喝声。
“我们进去吧。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
工程师住前走去，他的伙伴们在二十步以外跟着他，仔细警戒着，随时准备开枪。
史密斯拔开门上的内闩，正打算推进去，这时候，托普忽然大叫起来。只听见“砰！”的一声，紧接着就是一声惨叫。
一颗子弹打中了赫伯特，他立刻直挺挺地倒在地上。
Book 3 Chapter 7
At Herbert's cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.
"They have killed him!" he cried. "My boy! They have killed him!"
Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.
The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad's heart was still beating.
"He lives," said he, "but he must be carried--"
"To Granite House? that is impossible!" replied the engineer.
"Into the corral, then!" said Pencroft.
"In a moment," said Harding.
And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the heart by Harding's dagger, more sure even than his gun.
During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which supported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor Herbert was lying on Ayrton's bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his side.
On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor's grief was terrible.
He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.
Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves were choked with emotion. They could not speak.
However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine. He knew a little of everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword-bayonet or shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.
The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock, the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent concussion.
Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt it beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.
These symptoms were very serious.
Herbert's chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.
The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,--an oval below the chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had been hit by the bullet.
Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his last sigh.
Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by which the ball had immediately escaped.
"God be praised!" said the reporter, "the ball is not in the body, and we shall not have to extract it."
"But the heart?" asked Harding.
"The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!"
"Dead!" exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.
The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.
"No, Pencroft," replied Cyrus Harding, "no! He is not dead. His pulse still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy's sake, calm yourself. We have need of all our self-possession."
"Do not make us lose it, my friend."
Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down his cheeks.
In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and proceed methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the ball, entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued behind between the third and fourth. But what mischief had the ball committed in its passage? What important organs had been reached? A professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once, and still more so the reporter.
However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with the local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound, perhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what antiphiogistics ought to be employed? By what means could inflammation be prevented?
At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should be dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid water, and compressing their lips. The hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of blood.
The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water.
Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that position.
"He must not be moved." said Gideon Spilett. "He is in the most favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate easily, and absolute rest is necessary."
"What! can't we carry him to Granite House?" asked Pencroft.
"No, Pencroft," replied the reporter.
"I'll pay the villains off!" cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a menacing manner.
"Pencroft!" said Cyrus Harding.
Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert was still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.
"Cyrus," said he, "I am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity. You must aid me with your advice, your experience!"
"Take courage, my friend," answered the engineer, pressing the reporter's hand. "Judge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be saved!"
These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility. He seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft had torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint.
Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first of all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause their immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation, and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest.
Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.
And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the inflammation which might occur?
Yes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold water, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians. Cold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute rest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable advantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous during the first days.
Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses of linen were applied to poor Herbert's two wounds, and were kept constantly wet with cold water.
The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting in things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same which the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to make some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any notice of it. His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night passed without his becoming conscious.
Herbert's life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any moment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his companions slightly revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor. He opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Pencroft. He uttered two or three words. He did not know what had happened. They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly still, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds would heal in a few days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of the wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular way, the fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the swelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister of mercy. like a mother by the bed of her child.
Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.
"Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett," said Pencroft. "Tell me again that you will save Herbert!"
"Yes, we will save him!" replied the reporter. "The wound is serious, and, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation of this organ is not fatal."
"God bless you!" answered Pencroft.
As may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in the corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing Herbert. They did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the future.
But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.
First of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton. Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he resisted, and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was only too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade, had clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern spur of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung. It was one of those whose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was found outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey's crew.
As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed, and the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could they see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut, or in the palisade. The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been supplied, had disappeared with him.
"The unhappy man has been surprised," said Harding, "and as he was a man to defend himself, he must have been overpowered."
"Yes, that is to be feared!" said the reporter. "Then, doubtless, the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything, and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident, too, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!"
"We shall have to beat the forest," said the engineer, "and rid the island of these wretches. Pencroft's presentiments were not mistaken, when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us all these misfortunes!"
"Yes," answered the reporter, "but now we have the right to be merciless!"
"At any rate," said the engineer, "we are obliged to wait some time, and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to Granite House."
"But Neb?" asked the reporter.
"Neb is in safety."
"But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?"
"He must not come!" returned Cyrus Harding quickly. "He would be murdered on the road!"
"It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!"
"Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is impossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could not do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House."
"No, no! Cyrus," answered the reporter, "you must not expose yourself! Your courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching the corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if you go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!"
"But Neb?" repeated the engineer. "It is now four-and-twenty hours since he has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!"
"And as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves," added Spilett, "he will be killed!"
"Is there really no way of warning him?"
While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards and forwards seemed to say,--
"Am not I here?"
"Top!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding.
The animal sprang at his master's call.
"Yes, Top will go," said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.
"Top can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!"
"Quick!" said Harding. "Quick!"
Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:--
"Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by Top."
This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same time asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and fastened to Top's collar in a conspicuous position.
"Top, my dog," said the engineer, caressing the animal, "Neb, Top! Neb! Go, go!"
Top bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of him. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he could clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding nor the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among the grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived.
The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.
"Neb, Top! Neb!" repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction of Granite House.
Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.
"He will get there!" said the reporter.
"Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!"
"What o'clock is it?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Ten."
"In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return."
The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter re-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the compresser always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do at that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while attentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at which an attack might be expected.
The settlers awaited Top's return with much anxiety. A little before eleven o'clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were behind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.
They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb would have sent him back immediately.
They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard, followed by repeated barks.
The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the wood, he fired in that direction.
Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly shut.
"Top, Top!" exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog's great honest head between his hands.
A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words, traced in Neb's large writing:--"No pirates in the neighborhood of Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!"
潘克洛夫一听见赫伯特的喊声，连忙跑过去，手里的枪也扔在地上了。
“他们把他打死了！”他叫道。“我的孩子！他们把他打死了！”
赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱也向赫伯特跑来。
通讯记者听了一下，打算确定可怜的少年的心脏是不是还在跳动。
“他还活着呢，”他说，“可是必须把他送到……”
“送到‘花岗石宫’去吗？那不可能！”工程师答道。
“那么，就抬到畜栏里去！”潘克洛夫说。
“赶快。”史密斯说。
他绕过栅栏的左角，就在那里，他发现一个罪犯正端枪对着他，一枪开来，打穿了他的帽子。工程师不等他开第二枪，就一刀刺进他的心口，这一刀比他开枪打的还要可靠些。说时迟，那时快，罪犯就倒在地上了。
这时候，吉丁•史佩莱和水手翻过栅栏，跳进围栏，拉开里门的门杠，跑进空屋去，不久以后，可怜的赫伯特就躺在艾尔通的床上了。过了一会儿，史密斯也来到了他的身边。
水手看见赫伯特晕过去，感到万分悲痛。他抽噎一阵哭—阵，一会儿又拿脑袋撞墙。工程师和通讯记者都没法使他平静下来。他们自己也悲痛得说不出话了。
然而，他们也知道，只有依靠自己，才能把眼前这个可怜的受苦的孩子从死亡的边缘救活过来。吉丁•史佩莱的一生中经历过许多周折，因此掌握了一些医药常识。他什么都懂得一点，他曾经有好几次不得不医治刀伤和枪伤。在赛勒斯•史密斯的帮助下，他开始对赫伯特进行必要的治疗。
通讯记者一上来就楞住了，因为赫伯特躺在那里完全失去了知觉；许由于流血过多，也许是枪弹力量过猛，打在骨头上，由于激烈的震荡而引起“休克”的缘故。
赫伯特面色惨白，史佩莱摸着他的脉搏，感到非常微弱，每隔很长时间才跳动一次，好象就要停止了似的。
病情是严重的。
他们解开赫伯特的衣裳，使他露出胸膛，用手帕止住血液往外流，然后用冷水洗擦他的心口。
赫伯特的伤口是一个椭圆形的窟窿，它的部位在胸膛以下，第三根和第四根肋骨之间，枪弹就是从这里打进去的。
接着赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱让可怜的少年翻过身来；翻身的时候，少年微弱地呻吟了一声，他们几乎以为这是他临终前的叹息了。
赫伯特的背后还有一处创伤，伤口染满了鲜血，这是枪弹穿出去的地方。
“谢天谢地！”通讯记者说，“枪弹不在身体里边，我们用不着把它取出来了。”
“可是心脏呢？”史密斯问道。
“没有碰到心脏；要是碰到的话，赫伯特早死了！”
“死了？”潘克洛夫哼了一声。
水手只听见通讯记者所说的最后两个字。
“没有，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“没有！他没有死。他的脉搏还在跳动。他还呻吟了一声呢。为了你的孩子着想，你还是平静一些吧。我们非常需要沉着。不要闹得大家都沉不住气，朋友。”
潘克洛夫不开口了，可是他听了以后，又引起他的伤心，大粒的眼泪从他的脸上滚了下来。
这时候，吉丁•史佩莱打算集中思想，有条不紊地进行医疗。经过检查，他肯定枪弹是从前胸进去，从后面穿出来的。可是枪弹在穿过身体内部的时候，进行了哪些破坏呢？它碰到了哪些重要的器官？这对一个真正的外科医师来说，也很难一下子判断出来，更不要说是一个通讯记者了。
可是，有一点他很清楚，那就是：必须防止伤口发炎造成血脉不通，然后和由于创伤（也许是致命的创伤！）而将要引起的局部发炎和高烧进行斗争：现在，应该用什么敷药，用什么消炎剂呢，怎样才能防止发炎呢。
别的先不管，目前最重要的还是赶紧把两处创口敷裹起来。吉丁•史佩莱认为不必用温水洗涤伤处，也不必挤压创口，因为那就会引起流血。赫伯特出血已经很多了，现在已经由于流血过多而变得十分虚弱。
因此，通讯记者认为最好简单地用冷水洗涤这两处创口。
赫伯特往左侧身躺着，保持着这个姿势。
“不能让他动，”吉丁•史佩莱说。“这个姿势对于他的背上和胸部的创口排脓最有利，应该保持这个姿势，现在必须让他保持绝对的休息。”
“什么！我们不能把他抬回‘花岗石宫’去吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“不能，潘克洛夫。”通讯记者回答说。
“我一定要和这帮匪徒算账！”水手大声说，他带着吓唬人的神气，挥舞着拳头。
“潘克洛夫！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
吉丁•史佩莱又继续诊断受伤的少年了。赫伯特的面色还是惨白得可怕，通讯记者心里非常焦急。
“赛勒斯，”他说，“我不是一个外科医生。我简直不知道该怎么办了。你应该给我出些主意，介绍一点经验！”
“鼓起勇气来吧，朋友，”工程师一面说，一面紧紧地握着通讯记者的手。“诊断的时候冷静一些。只想着一件事：一定要挽救赫伯特！”
吉丁•史佩莱感到责任重大，本来已经鼓不起勇气来了，这几句话又使他恢复了原有的沉着。他紧挨床坐着。赛勒斯•史密斯站在旁边。潘克洛夫撕下自己的衬衫，没精打采地在做绷带。
史佩莱向赛勒斯•史密斯解释，他认为首先应该制止出血，但是不能堵塞创伤，或是使伤口立刻长上，因为内脏被打穿了，不能把脓留在胸膛里。
史密斯完全同意，于是通讯记者决定不立刻把两个伤口缝合，暂时把它们敷裹起来。好在这两处创口都不用扩创。
发炎是很可能发生的，居民们有没有防止发炎的灵药呢？
有的。他们有一种，大自然慷慨地供应他们。他们有冷水，这是用来防止伤口发炎最有效的镇静剂，治疗严重症候的灵药，现在的医生，没有一个不用它的。冷水还有一个好处，它能使创口保持绝对休息，在一切过早的敷裹情况下保护创口。这是一个很大的优点，因为根据经验，最初几天和空气接触是非常危险的。
吉丁•史佩莱和赛勒斯•史密斯运用他们简单而良好的理智，进行了以上的判断，然后和最好的外科医生一样，进行了医疗。他们把敷布敷在可怜的赫伯特的两处创口上，不断用冷水保持敷布的湿润。
水手一开始就在屋子里生了火。各种生活必需品屋子里都不缺。这里有枫糖，还有各种药草——就是少年从格兰特湖畔搜集来的那些种——因此他们熬了一些清凉的饮料，当他们喂给少年的时候，他完全失去了知觉。他的热度很高，一昼夜过去了，他还没有苏醒过来。
赫伯特的生命可以说是千钧一发，这根头发随时都有断的可能。第二天是11月12日，史密斯和他的伙伴们总算有了一线希望。赫伯特从长时间的昏迷状态中醒过来了。他睁开眼睛，认出了赛勒斯•史密斯、通讯记者和潘克洛夫。他说了两三句话。究竟发生了些什么事情，他完全不知道。大家把经过都告诉他了，史佩莱要求他绝对不要动，告诉他已经没有生命的危险，再过几天，创口就可以复原了。赫伯特几乎没有感到任何痛苦，由于他们经常用冷水清涤，创口一点也没有发炎。化脓的过程很正常，体温也没有增高，现在可以希望这个可怕的创伤不致造成不幸的后果了。潘克洛夫渐渐地放下心来。他现在就象一个修女，一个坐在爱儿床边的慈母一样。
赫伯特又昏昏沉沉地睡着了，可是这次他睡得比较自然。
“再说一遍，你是有信心的，史佩莱先生，”潘克洛夫说。“再说一遍，你要救活赫伯特！”
“是的，我们要救活他！”通讯记者说。“伤势很严重，枪弹甚至可能穿透了他的肺，可是打穿了肺也不会致命。”
“上帝保佑你！”潘克洛夫说。
可以想象，居民们在畜栏里的这二十四小时内，脑子里所想的只有看护赫伯特的问题。他们既没有考虑如果罪犯们回来，自己会遇到哪些危险，也没有计划应该怎样预防将来。
这一天，当潘克洛夫守在病床旁边的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者谈到目前该怎么办才好。
首先，他们细细地检查了畜栏。哪儿也没有艾尔通的影子。这个不幸的人是不是被从前的部下架走了呢？他是不是进行了反抗，在斗争中被打败了呢？后一个假定的可能性非常大。吉丁•史佩莱爬上栅栏的时候，曾经清清楚楚地看见一个罪犯沿着富兰克林山的南部支脉逃跑，当时托普向他赶去了。慈悲河口的岩石撞坏了罪犯们的小船，使他们的企图彻底粉碎了，这个跑掉的亡命之徒就是他们之中的一个。还有史密斯刺死的那个歹徒，还躺在畜栏的外边，他当然也是鲍勃•哈维的党徒。
畜栏并没有遭到什么损坏。大门关得好好的，牲畜也没能逃到森林里去。不论是在屋子里，还是在栅栏里，他们都没有发现任何格斗和破坏的痕迹。不过艾尔通的武器却和他一起不见了。
“这个不幸的人遭到了袭击，”史密斯说，“他是一个善于自卫的人，准是最后抵挡不住了。”
“不错，恐怕是这样，”通讯记者说。“罪犯们看到畜栏里什么都有，一定就在这里住了下来，直到看见我们上这儿来才逃走的。同时，还有一点也很明显，不管艾尔通是死是活，我们来的时候，他已经不在这儿了！”
“我们一定要到森林里去搜索，”工程师说，“把这些匪徒从岛上消灭掉。潘克洛夫曾经打算象逮野兽似的追捕他们，这种预见是正确的。要是早那么做，就不少发生这些不幸的事故了！”
“是的，”通讯记者说，“现在我们不妨狠起心来干！”
“可是，”工程师说，“我们还只能暂时在畜栏里住一个时期，等到赫伯特不会因为移动而出什么危险的时候，再把他带回‘花岗石宫’去。”
“可是纳布呢？”通讯记者问道。
“纳布不会遇到危险的。”
“可是，假如他因为我们老不回去而着急，冒险跑到这儿来呢？”
“他不能来！”赛勒斯•史密斯很快地说，“他会在半路上被杀死的！”
“可是他很可能来找我们！”
“唉，要是电报还灵，我们可以警告他！现在却办不到了！我们决不能单把潘克洛夫和赫伯特留在这里！好吧，我一个人到‘花岗石宫’去一趟。”
“不能，不能！赛勒斯，”通讯记者说，“你不能暴露自己！这样冒险是没有必要的。匪徒们一定在监视着畜栏，他们躲在周围的密林里，你一走，我们的不幸事故马上就要由一件变成两件了！”
“可是纳布呢？”工程师重复道。“他已经整整一昼夜没有得到我们的消息了！他一定会上这儿来的！”
“并且他既然不知道应该象我们这样小心提防，”史佩莱补充说，“他一定会被打死的！”
“难道真的没有办法警告他了吗？”
当工程师在动脑筋的时候，他的眼光落在托普身上，托普走来走去，好象在说：
“我不是在这儿吗？”
“托普！”赛勒斯•史密斯叫道。
托普听见主人叫它，就跳起身来。
“对，托普可以去，”通讯记者明白了工程师的意思。“我们不能去的地方，托普都能去！可以让它把畜栏的消息带给‘花岗石宫’，然后再把‘花岗石宫’的消息带回来！”
“快！”史密斯说。“赶快！”
史佩莱急忙从笔记本上撕下一张纸来，在上面写着：
赫伯特受伤了。我们在吉栏。自己留神。不要离开“花岗石宫”。罪犯到附近来过没有？让托普把回信带给我们。
这封短信把要告诉纳布的话都包括在内了，同时也提出了居民们想知道的一切。他们把纸条折起来，系在托普颈部一个显眼的地方。
“托普，我的托普，”工程师一面说，一面抚摩着它，“纳布，托普！纳布！去，去！”
托普听见以后，来回乱跳。它明白工程师的意思，它知道大家要它做什么。畜栏路它是熟悉的，用不了一个钟头，它就可以走完这条路；不论是赛勒斯•史密斯还是通讯记者，目前要通过这条路，都必须冒着很大的危险，然而托普却可以在野草和密林中间，神不知鬼不觉地穿过去。
工程师走到畜栏门口，把门打开。
“纳布，托普！纳布！”工程师重复着，又指了指去“花岗石宫”的方向。
托普往前一跳，几乎立刻就不见了。
“它会到那儿的！”通讯记者说。
“是的，并且肯定它还会回来，忠实的狗！”
“几点钟了？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“十点钟。”
“一个钟头之内，它就可以到了。我们等着它回来吧。”
他们关上畜栏的门。工程师和通讯记者又回到屋里来了。赫伯特还没有醒。潘克洛夫始终保持着敷布的湿润。史佩莱一时觉得没有什么可做，就忙着准备一些富有营养的食品，同时他还不时注意着山那边的栅栏，因为匪徒可能从那边攻击。
居民们焦急不安地等待着托普。将近十一点钟的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者拿着步枪，站在门后，准备一听见狗叫就去开门。
他们深信这一点，如果托普平安到达“花岗石宫”，纳布一定会立刻打发它回来的。
他们等了约有十分钟，忽然听见一声枪响，接着就是几声狗叫。
工程师打开大门，只见一百英尺以外的森林里有一缕烟，他立刻朝那里开了一枪。
托普几乎立刻就跳进畜栏来了，他们赶紧关上大门。
“托普，托普！”工程师两手搂住忠实的托普的脖子，叫道。
它的颈部拴着一张纸条，上面是纳布写的几个大字。
赛勒斯•史密斯念道：
“花岗石宫”附近没有海盗。我不会乱动。可怜的赫伯特。
Book 3 Chapter 8
So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to kill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but to treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for just now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not being seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements, therefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time. Ayrton's house had been provided with all that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was probable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as follows:
The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they had reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the right bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they could not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited. There they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton's arrival had surprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and--the rest may be easily imagined!
Now, the convicts,--reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,--were roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to their attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.
"Wait! There is nothing else to be done!" repeated Cyrus Harding. "When Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and have satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our grand expedition at the same time--"
"As the search for our mysterious protector," added Gideon Spilett, finishing the engineer's sentence. "An, it must be acknowledged, my dear Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when it was most necessary to us!"
"Who knows?" replied the engineer.
"What do you mean?" asked the reporter.
"That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett, and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert's life before everything."
This was the colonists' saddest thought. Several days passed, and the poor boy's state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a suitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the wounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly sulphurous,--which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration was much less abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was surrounded!--Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated. He was besides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad's wounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert's wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much nor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing, knowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that which most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well performed.
In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better. He had begun to take some nourishment.
The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at his nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft's efforts, who talked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him the most improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that he was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert, contented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to defend Granite House.
"Humph!" said Pencroft, "these pirates! they are gentlemen who have no right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by kindness! I'll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good bullet!"
"And have they not been seen again?" asked Herbert.
"No, my boy," answered the sailor, "but we shall find them, and when you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will dare to meet us face to face!"
"I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!"
"Well! your strength will return gradually! What's a ball through the chest? Nothing but a joke! I've seen many, and I don't think much of them!"
At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication occurred, Herbert's recovery might be regarded as certain. But what would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated, --if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated?
"No," said Spilett more than once, "I have never thought of such a contingency without shuddering!"
"And yet, if it had been necessary to operate," said Harding one day to him, "you would not have hesitated?"
"No, Cyrus!" said Gideon Spilett, "but thank God that we have been spared this complication!"
As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic of that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone on the island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each other. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some circumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount. It appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate, had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and a half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might be said that they had had everything their own way. The island had abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take advantage of what she offered them.
The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all that could only be for a time.
In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.
In fact, the convicts' ship had appeared in the waters of the island, and if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of them, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the island, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived. Ayrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This was often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the intervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served them so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had he in his turn succumbed?
No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined that because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were men to despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face, they analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they stood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last to strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against it.
事实说明，罪犯们还在附近监视着畜栏，企图把居民们一个一个地杀死。对待这些强盗没有别的办法，只能把他们当作野兽。现在居民们必须加倍小心，因为目前的形势对这帮匪徒有利，他们看得见居民，居民却看不见他们，他们可以采取冷不提防的突击，而本身却不会受到意外的进攻。于是史密斯作了一些安排，打算住在畜栏里。这里的食品还可以维持一个相当长的时期。艾尔通的房子里备有各种生活必需品，由于居民们来得突然，罪犯们来不及把东西抢走就吓跑了。根据吉丁•史佩莱的估计，事情的经过可能是这样的：这六个罪犯在岛上登陆以后，沿着南部海滨前进，他们从盘蛇半岛的海岸这边一直穿到海岸那边，没有冒险进入远西森林，却到了瀑布河口。从河口沿着右岸可以一直走到富兰克林山的支脉下，在那里不难找到一个安身的地方，这样，很快就发现当时没有人住的畜栏了。他们在这里正式地住了下来，随时准备着实现他们可怕的阴谋。艾尔通回到畜栏里来使他们吃了一惊，可是他们到底想法子打败了这个不幸的人——其余的情况就不难想象了！
不错，现在只剩下了五个罪犯，可是他们却都是全副武装，而且在森林里出没。要冒险到森林里去，就等于送上门去让他们打；对于他们的攻击，既不能预防，又不能阻止。
“等着吧！现在想不出别的办法！”赛勒斯•史密斯一再地说。“等赫伯特好了以后，我们要在岛上进行一次全面的搜捕，那时候就可以拿这帮罪犯出一口气了。这就是我们大规模出征的目的，同时……”
“我们还要寻找那位神秘的保卫者，”吉丁•史佩莱接着说出了工程师要说的话。“啊，应该承认，亲爱的赛勒斯，在这次最紧要的关头，他却没有保护我们！”
“谁知道呢？”工程师说。
“这话是什么意思？”通讯记者问道。
“我们还没有到山穷水尽的地步呢，亲爱的史佩莱，他也许会在另外的一个场合，运用他的创造性的力量的。可是这不是当前的重要问题，现在重要的是赫伯特的性命问题。”
这是居民们最担心的事。又过了几天，幸而可怜的少年，情况并没有恶化。冷水始终保持着适当的温度，因此到现在为止，创口一点儿没有发炎。由于靠近火山，水里含有少量的硫，通讯记者甚至觉得它能直接起医疗作用。多亏周围的人不断看护，赫伯特保住了性命，化脓比以前少得多了，热度也下降了。由于他们严格地限制他的饮食，因此他的身体变得非常虚弱，而且以后还要继续一个时期；然而清凉的饮料却可以尽量喝，同时，对他说来，只要保持绝对的休息就有莫大的好处。赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫敷裹少年的创口的技术已经十分高明。屋子里的布料全都给他用光了。赫伯特的创口上盖着敷布和棉花，包扎得不松不紧，以便使创口合拢而不致最后出现发炎的反映。通讯记者在敷裹的过程中十分仔细，他知道这道手续的重要性，他一再向伙伴们谈到绝大部分的外科医生都承认的一件事实，那就是：良好的敷裹比良好的手术更加少见。
十天以后，11月22日，赫伯特的身体好得多了。他已经开始吃一些营养品。他的脸上重新出现了原有的光彩，他睁着亮晶晶的眼睛对看护们微笑着。尽管潘克洛夫费尽气力，不住嘴地和他说话，把最稀奇古怪的故事讲给他听，好不让他有机会开口；可是他还是说了几句。赫伯特问到艾尔通，他以为艾尔通还在畜栏里，因为没有看见他，感到有些奇怪。水手为了不让赫伯特难受，只好回说艾尔通和纳布一起保卫“花岗石宫”去了。
“哼！”潘克洛夫说，“这些强盗！这些家伙丝毫也不值得怜借！史密斯先生还想用仁义道德去说服他们呢：我也要给他们一些仁义道德，不过我的仁义道德就是大粒的子弹！”
“以后没有再发现他们吗？”赫伯特问道。
“没有，孩子，”水手回答说，“可是我们会找到他们的，等你好了以后，我们就可以瞧瞧，看这些暗箭伤人的胆小鬼敢不敢露面！”
“我的身体还很弱呢，我的潘克洛夫！”
“不要紧！你的体力慢慢就会恢复的！一颗子弹打穿胸口算得了什么？简直是开玩笑：这种事情我见得多了，没有什么了不起的！”
情况终于好转了，要是不再有什么共发症，赫伯特的痊愈就可以肯定了。可是，如果他的伤势比现在严重得多——譬如枪弹在身体内部没出来，或是必须锯断手足——那时候移民们该怎么办呢？
“真的，”史佩莱不止一次地说，“一想到这种意外的时候，我就止不住要打寒噤！”
“可是，如果到了不动手术就不行的时候，”史密斯有一天对他说，“你会犹豫吗？”
“不会，赛勒斯！”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是谢天谢地，幸亏没有发生这样的共发症！”
居民们过去曾经屡次运用他们的简单而良好的理智进行分析讨论，这次和往常一样，多亏他们的一般常识丰富，结果又成功了！但是会不会遇到用尽他们的全部科学知识，仍旧解决不了困难的时候呢？社会上是必须有各种人在一起互相依赖的，岛上却只有他们这一群人。赛勒斯•史密斯非常明白这一点，有时候他问自己，如果遇到他们无能为力的情况时，那应该怎么办呢？他还有一种看法，他和他的伙伴们一向是幸运的，现在似乎进入一个不幸的阶段了。可以这样说，自从他们逃出里士满，两年半以来，他们向来是想什么就能够有什么。岛上供给了他们大量的矿物、植物和动物。自然界不断地供应各种物资，他们也就不断地依靠自己所掌握的科学知识，充分地加以利用。
因此，小队是十分幸福的。并且，在某些情况下，还有一种不可思议的力量在帮助他们！……可是，这一切都仅仅是过去的情况。
一句话，赛勒斯•史密斯感到他们开始走下坡路了。
的确，由于罪犯们的船来到荒岛的沿海一带，虽然海盗们可说是神秘地毁灭了，但是至少其中有六个人逃脱了这场灾难。他们在岛上登了陆；要想捉住这五个残匪几乎是不可能的。艾尔通一定已经被他们杀害了，他们携带着武器，第一次使用武器，就险些要了赫伯特的命。史密斯常常想：这仅仅是厄运给移民们的第一次打击吗？通讯记者也常常这样反复地思索；他还感到，一向给他们很大帮助的神奇而有效的援救，现在对他们也不灵了。不管这个神秘的人是谁，反正肯定是有这么一个人的，他是不是已经离开荒岛了呢？是不是也轮到他没有办法的时候了呢？
这些问题是无法解答的。但是我们却不能认为，由于史密斯和他的伙伴们说出这样的话来，他们就灰心绝望了。决不是那样。他们面对着自己的处境，分析了一切可能，随时准备应付任何一种局面；他们坚忍不拔，不屈不挠地迎接未来。即使最后要遭到灾难的打击，他们也会勇往直前地进行斗争的。
Book 3 Chapter 9
The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One thing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be brought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some shot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that impregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited impatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.
They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.
They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton's disappearance they were only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause.
The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them.
"My friends," said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the impossibility of communicating with him, "I think,--like you, that to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot without being able to return it. But do you not think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?"
"That is just what I was thinking," answered Pencroft. "I believe we're not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding approves, I'm ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is equal to another!"
"But is he equal to five?" asked the engineer.
"I will join Pencroft," said the reporter, "and both of us, well-armed and accompanied by Top--"
"My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft," answered Harding, "let us reason coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they are sure to fire the first shot?"
"Well, captain," cried Pencroft, "a bullet does not always reach its mark."
"That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should remain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?"
"You are right, captain," replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with sullen anger. "You are right; they will do all they can to retake the corral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold it against them."
"Oh, if we were only at Granite House!"
"If we were at Granite House," answered the engineer, "the case would be very different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one, while the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we are at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it together."
Cyrus Harding's reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions understood it well.
"If only Ayrton was still one of us!" said Gideon Spilett. "Poor fellow! his return to social life will have been but of short duration."
"If he is dead," added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.
"Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?" asked Gideon Spilett.
"Yes, if they had any interest in doing so."
"What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting all that he owes us--"
"Who knows?" answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful supposition without hesitating.
"Pencroft," said Harding, taking the sailor's arm, "that is a wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus. I will answer for Ayrton's fidelity."
"And I also," added the reporter quickly.
"Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong," replied Pencroft; "it was a wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I'm not in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly, and I have never felt so excited as I do now.
"Be patient, Pencroft," replied the engineer. "How long will it be, my dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?"
"That is difficult to say, Cyrus," answered the reporter, "for any imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from now-- well, we shall see."
Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the first days of December. At this time two months of spring had already passed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural labors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.
It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists.
But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so without impatience.
Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the tour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.
He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.
However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett, who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south of the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious object to him.
Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice, while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the presence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor approaching.
Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush, and drew out a rag.
It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately brought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists, who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton's waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.
"You see, Pencroft," observed Harding, "there has been resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in spite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?"
"No, captain," answered the sailor, "and I repented of my suspicion a long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the incident."
"What is that?" asked the reporter.
"It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still living!"
"Perhaps, indeed," replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.
This was a hope, to which Ayrton's companions could still hold. Indeed, they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not killed him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of the island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows but that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him turn traitor!
This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again. On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!
"At any rate," observed Gideon Spilett, "if happily Ayrton did manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and consequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral."
"Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!" cried Pencroft, "and that we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!"
Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops. But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers was needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral! Therefore, one idea occupied his mind--to leave the corral, and when! He believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight of the sea!
Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with good reason, that Herbert's wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start.
However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his two friends to yield to the lad's wish, and God alone knew that this determination might cause them grief and remorse.
It was the 29th of November, seven o'clock in the evening. The three settlers were talking in Herbert's room, when they heard Top utter quick barks.
Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it was with pleasure, not anger.
"Some one is coming."
"Yes."
"It is not an enemy!"
"Neb, perhaps?"
"Or Ayrton?"
These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground inside the corral.
It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most cordial reception.
"Jup!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Neb has sent him to us," said the reporter.
"Then," replied the engineer, "he must have some note on him."
Pencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could, nor even Top himself.
Cyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup's neck hung a small bag, and in this bag was found a little note traced by Neb's hand.
The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read these words:--
"Friday, six o'clock in the morning.
"Plateau invaded by convicts.
"Neb."
They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered the house. what were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that was disaster, devastation, ruin.
Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter, guessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no longer doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.
"Captain Harding," said he, "I must go; I can bear the journey. I must go."
Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,--
"Let us go, then!" said he.
The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion of the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would they not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free? Was it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could be done.
The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and the reporter raised Herbert's mattress and placed it on the bottom of the cart. The weather was fine. The sun's bright rays glanced through the trees.
"Are the guns ready?" asked Cyrus Harding.
They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.
"Are you comfortable, Herbert?" asked the engineer.
"Ah, captain," replied the lad, "don't be uneasy, I shall not die on the road!"
While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his failing strength.
The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to give the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to despair--killed him perhaps.
"Forward!" said Harding.
The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.
Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than that which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart would have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was necessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to the convicts.
Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart, ready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.
Neb's note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o'clock in the morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be safe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House. However, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter armed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road, signalized no danger.
The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft's guidance. It had left the corral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles had been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was as deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the Mercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island.
They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge over Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place; supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after having passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they would have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a retreat.
At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen. But the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders thought of abandoning it.
At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,--
"Oh! the villains!" he exclaimed.
And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the buildings at the poultry-yard.
A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.
His companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.
The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having devastated it!
"And Mr. Herbert?" asked Neb.
Gideon Spilett returned to the cart.
Herbert had lost consciousness!
少年的病况正常地好转了。现在只等一件事，就是等他病势好转到一定的程度，就把他抬回“花岗石宫”去。不管畜栏盖得多么好，里面什么都不缺，但是总不比“花岗石宫”那样舒服，那样适合健康。并且，畜栏里也不如那里安全，虽然居民们非常小心，他们还是怕罪犯们暗地里向他们开枪。在“花岗石宫”里就不同了，它在坚固而高耸的峭壁中间，在里面用不着顾虑什么，任何进攻的企图都注定会失败的。于是他们焦急地等待着，一旦等到赫伯特不致因移动而给创口带来危险的时候，他们就要动身了。要想通过啄木鸟林虽然有很大的困难，他们还是下定决心要搬回去。
他们得不到纳布的消息，但是他们并没有为这件事而担心。勇敢的黑人坚守在“花岗石宫”里，是不会受到袭击的。他们没有再派托普到他那里去，因为把这只忠实的狗送给敌人射击，只能使居民们丧失一个最得力的助手，决不会有任何好处。
因此，虽然他们急着要到“花岗石宫”里去聚会，但还是等待着。工程师看到自己的兵力分散，使海盗们有机可乘，感到非常苦恼。自从艾尔通失踪以后，只剩下他们四个人在对抗五个匪徒，赫伯特现在当然不能计算在内；这一点，勇敢的少年非常关心，他十分明白自己给大家造成的困难。
11月26日，当赫伯特睡着了听不见的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫详细地讨论了在他们所处的环境里，应该怎样对付海盗的问题。
“朋友们，”他们谈过纳布以及不能和他联系的问题以后，通讯记者说，“我的想法和你们一样，如果从畜栏路上冒险走回去，那末，只能挨打，不能还手。依我看，我们倒不如大张旗鼓地去追赶这帮匪徒。”
“我完全同意，”潘克洛夫说。“我敢说我们都不是怕吃子弹的人；拿我来说吧，只要史密斯先生答应，我随时都可以冲进森林去！真是岂有此理！只要是人，不是一个抵一个吗？”
“可是抵得了五个吗？”工程师问道。
“我和潘克洛夫一起去，”通讯记者说，“我们两个人全副武装，带着托普……”
“亲爱的史佩莱，还有你，潘克洛夫，”史密斯说，“我们冷静地考虑一下吧。要是罪犯们躲在荒岛上一个什么地方，如果我们探清了那个地方，只等把他们赶出来，我是会直接向他们发动进攻的；可是事实恰好相反，他们肯定会先开枪打我们，这是一点儿也不用怀疑的。”
“可是，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫叫道，“子弹不一定就能够打中的。”
“赫伯特却被打中了，潘克洛夫，”工程师说。“并且，你再想想，你们两个人离开了畜栏，这里就只剩下我一个人防守了。你想，你们走的时候，罪犯们会看不见吗？他们明知道这里没有别人，只有一个受了伤的孩子和我，难道不会放你们到森林里去，乘你们不在的时候，向这里进攻吗？”
“你说得对，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫憋着一肚子气回答说。“你说得对，他们知道畜栏里什么都有，他们会尽一切力量来重新霸占畜栏的；你一个人当然挡不住他们。”
“唉，要是我们在‘花岗石宫’里就好了！”
“要是我们在‘花岗石宫’里，”工程师说，“情况就完全不同了。在那里把赫伯特留给一个人照顾，让其余的三个人到森林里去搜索，那我完全用不着担心。可是现在我们是在畜栏里，最好还是等到大家能一起走的时候再离开这里。”
赛勒斯•史密斯的论点是无可辩驳的，他的伙伴们非常明白这一点。
“要是艾尔通还活着就好了！”吉丁•史佩莱说。“可怜的人！他回到集体中间来仅仅是那么短短的一段时期。”
“这是不是说他已死了。”潘克洛夫用一种奇怪的嗓音补充了一句。
“那么，潘克洛夫，你认为匪徒们没有把他杀死吗？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“是的，如果对他们有利，他们不会杀死他的。”
“什么？你认为艾尔通一看见他过去的党羽，就会忘记我们对他的好处……”
“那谁知道呢？”他也觉得这种可耻的想法有些说不出口，因此说的时候吞吞吐吐。
“潘克洛夫，”史密斯抓住水手的胳膊说，“这是一个很坏的想法，如果你坚持要这样说，你会使我非常痛心的。我敢担保艾尔通是忠实可靠的。”
“我也敢保证。”通讯记者也急忙补充道。
“是的，是的，史密斯先生，我错了，”潘克洛夫说，“我的想法的确太坏了，这样想是没有丝毫根据的。可是我有什么办法呢？我已经晕头转向了。成天关在畜栏里使我烦得要命，我从来没有象现在这样不安心。”
“耐心点，潘克洛夫，”工程师说。“亲爱的史佩莱，你认为要再过多久才能把赫伯特抬到‘花岗石宫’去呢？”
“那很难说，赛勒斯，”通讯记者答道，“只要有一点不小心，就可能引起严重后果。可是他现在一天比一天好转，如果继续增加体力，那么从现在起，八天以后——嗯，我们再等等看吧。”
八天！这就是说，要延迟到十二月初才能回“花岗石宫”。现在春天已经过去两个月了。气候很好，也开始热起来了。荒岛上森林的枝叶已经长得非常茂盛，按季节说，收割的时候也快到了。因此，回到眺望岗的高地以后，除了按照计划彻底探索荒岛以外，接着就要下地干重活了。
从这一点可以看出，移民们这样困守在畜栏里，所受的损失是非常严重的。
他们在这种环境下作了不得已的让步，然而他们内心里是十分焦急的。
有一两次，通讯记者冒险到栏外的路上去，在栅栏周围巡视。托普陪着他，吉丁•史佩莱扣着板机，随时准备迎接任何危险。
他没有遇到什么灾难，也没有发现任何可疑的踪迹。只要有一点危险，托普就会警告他的；既然它没有叫，可以这样说，至少当时没有什么可顾虑的，罪犯们大概在荒岛的其他地方干什么勾当去了。
11月27日那天，吉丁•史佩莱进行了第二次侦察，他往山的南部，冒险向森林里深入了四分之一英里。这一次他感觉出托普似乎闻到了什么。它不象过去那样漫不经心了。它来回乱跑，在野草和灌木中间搜索，好象闻到什么可疑的东西似的。
吉丁•史佩莱跟着托普，他一面鼓励它，唤起它的注意，一面留神监视，他躲在树的后边，随时准备开枪。托普所闻到的，也许不是人；因为根据过去的习惯，如果是人，它总是阴沉沉地低声怒吼。现在它并没有怒吼，可见附近并没有危险，也没有危险即将到来的迹象。
过了将近五分钟，托普还在搜索，通讯记者小心翼翼地跟着它。突然，托普向一棵枝叶茂密的灌木冲去，一会儿衔出一块破布来。
这是一块肮脏的破布，史佩莱立刻把它带回畜栏。移民们仔细看了一下，发现这是从艾尔通背心上撕下来的一块毡子，正是独一无二的“花岗石宫”工场里的产品。
“你看，潘克洛夫，”史密斯说，“不幸的艾尔通曾经反抗过。罪犯们硬把他架走了！你还怀疑他不忠实吗？”
“不怀疑了，史密斯先生，”水手回答说，“我早就后悔不该这样怀疑了！可是我认为通过这件事情，可以得出一个结论来。”
“什么结论？”通讯记者问道。
“艾尔通不是在畜栏里被杀的！他既然挣扎过，那么被架走的时候，他一定还没有死。因此，也许他还活着呢！”
“的确，这是可能的。”工程师答道，他还在沉思。
艾尔通的伙伴们现在可以抱着这样一个希望了。在这以前他们是这样想的，艾尔通在畜栏里遇到了袭击，象赫伯特似的，被一枪打倒了。如果在一开始的时候罪犯们没有打死他，如果他们把他活着架到荒岛的其他地方去，能不能认为他目前还在作他们的俘虏呢？也许罪犯们中间有人认出了艾尔通是昔日的逃犯首领，化名为彭•觉斯的澳洲伙伴。谁知道他们会不会妄想使艾尔通重新入伙呢？如果他们能使艾尔通变成叛徒，对他们说来，用处是很大的！
经过大家的分析，畜栏里的人一致认为这件事对自己有利，他们不再认为不可能重新找到艾尔通了。在艾尔通这方面来说，只要他还是个俘虏，他一定会想尽办法从匪徒们的魔掌里逃出来的，这对居民们说来，将是一个非常有力的帮助！
“不管怎么样！”吉丁•史佩莱说，“如果艾尔通真能侥幸地逃出来，他一定会直接到‘花岗石宫’去的，因为他还不知道匪徒们这次的暗杀阴谋，以及赫伯特作了阴谋的牺牲品，所以他绝想不到我们会困守在畜栏里！”
“啊！但愿他在那儿，在‘花岗石宫’里！”潘克洛夫叫道，“但愿我们也在那儿！要不然这些流氓虽然没法破坏我们的房子，他们却可能去洗劫我们的高地、农场和家禽场！”
潘克洛夫已经变成一个十足的庄稼汉了，他从心里挂虑他的庄稼。但是必须说明，最急于想回“花岗石宫”的却是赫伯特，他知道目前居民们最好是回到那里去。但是大家却因为他而固守在畜栏里！因此，他脑子里只有一个念头——离开畜栏，什么时候能够离开？他相信他已经可以经得起迁移的劳累了。他深信在自己那间面临大海、有海风调节空气的房间里，他的体力一定可以恢复得更快的！
他几次催促吉丁•史佩莱，可是史佩莱始终没有下令动身，他的理由很正确，创伤还没有完全收回，怕在路上重新迸裂开来。
可是，不久发生了一件事，使赛勒斯•史密斯和他的两个伙伴不得不答应少年的要求。天晓得，这个决定竟会给他们带来悲痛和悔恨。
11月29日晚上七点钟，三个居民正在赫伯特的房里谈话，突然听到托普急促的吠叫声。
史密斯、潘克洛夫和史佩莱抓起枪就往外面跑。托普在栅栏底下一面叫，一面跳，但是它好象很高兴，而不是发怒。
“有人来了。”
“是的。”
“不是敌人！”
“会不会是纳布？”
“也许是艾尔通？”
工程师和他的两个伙伴话还没有说完，就有一个东西翻过栅栏，跳进畜栏来了。
原来是杰普，是小杰普亲自来了。托普立刻向它表示热烈的欢迎。
“杰普！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“准是纳布派它到我们这儿来的。”通讯记者说。
“那么，”工程师说，“它身上一定有信。”
潘克洛夫急忙跑到猩猩身边去。肯定地说，如果纳布有什么重要的消息要传达给他的主人，他再也找不到比杰普更可靠更迅速的通讯员了；不仅移民们没法通过的地方它能走，甚至连托普走不过去的地方，它都能过去。
赛勒斯•史密斯没有猜错。杰普的脖子底下挂着一个小口袋，口袋里有—张纳布亲笔写的纸条。
当史密斯和他的伙伴们看到下面这些话的时候，他们的懊恼是可以想象的。
星期五早上六点钟。
高地遭到罪犯的侵袭。
纳布
大家你看着我，我看着你，一句话也没有说，然后回到屋子里去了。他们该怎么办呢？罪犯们在眺望岗上！那就意昧着灾难、抢劫和破坏。
赫伯特看见工程师、通讯记者和潘克洛夫进来，就已经猜到他们的处境大概又变坏了，等到看见杰普，他毫不怀疑，“花岗石宫”准是遭到了不幸的威胁。
“史密斯先生，”他说，“我一定要走；我经得起路上的劳累。我一定要走。”
吉丁•史佩莱走到赫伯特的身旁，看了他一会儿，然后说：
“那么，我们走吧！”
究竟用担架抬赫伯特，还是用艾尔通驾来的大车呢？这个问题很快就决定了。用担架抬对受伤的少年比较适合一些，但是它需要两个人抬，也就是说，如果在路上遇到攻击，要自卫就少了两支枪。相反地，如果利用大车，不就能把所有的人手都腾出来了吗？至于怕沿路颠簸，他们如果把赫伯特现在所铺的垫子放在车上，尽量小心地前进，不就可以避免了吗？这是可以办到的。
大车拉过来了。潘克洛夫套上野驴。赛勒斯•史密斯和通讯记者把赫伯特连垫子一起抬起来，放在大车里边。天气很好。明媚的阳光穿过树木，照耀着。
“枪都准备好了吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
一切都准备妥当了。工程师和潘克洛夫每人拿了一支双筒枪，吉丁•史佩莱带着他的步枪，现在只等出发了。
“你不觉得难受吗，赫伯特？”工程师问道。
“史密斯先生，”少年回答说，“你放心，我不会死在路上的！”
说话的时候，可以看得出来，可怜的少年鼓起了他的全身精力，在坚强的意志下，他振作起微弱的力量来。
工程师心里感到一阵难受，他还有些犹豫，不想下出发命令；可是那会使赫伯特失望的——也许会使他灰心郁闷而死。
“走吧！”史密斯说。
畜栏的门开了。杰普和托普知道什么时候应该保持安静，它们在前面引着路。大车出来以后，门又关上了。潘克洛夫牵着野驴，慢慢地向前走去。
如果不走畜栏路，另外选一条小道，肯定要比较安全些；可是，那就要从树底下穿过去，大车走起来很不方便。因此，虽然罪犯们非常熟悉这条道路，但他们还是非从这里走不可。
赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱一边一个，跟着大车前进，随时准备迎敌。其实，这时候罪犯们多半还没有离开眺望岗的高地呢？
纳布显然是在发现罪犯以后，立刻就把信写好发出去的。信上所写的时间是早上六点钟。机灵的猩猩来惯了畜栏，几乎用不了三刻钟，就可以从五英里以外的“花岗石宫”来到这里了。因此，在这路上的时候他们是不会遇到什么危险的。如果要开枪格斗，大概也得等到离“花岗石宫”不远才有可能。然而移民们还是小心地戒备着。杰普拿着棍子，和托普两个有时在前走，有时在路旁的森林里探索，都没有表示遇到什么危险。
潘克洛夫作向导，领着大车慢慢地前进。离开畜栏的时候，是早上七点半。走了一个钟头，五英里的路程已经走了四英里，还没有发生什么事情。沿路的情况和慈悲河到格兰特湖之间整个的啄木鸟林一样，都是静悄悄的，没有一点儿动静。现在没有什么需要发警报的。森林里和居民们第一天着陆的时候一样，没有丝毫人迹。
快到高地了。再过一英里，就可以看见甘油河上的吊桥。赛勒斯•史密斯猜想吊桥一定还好好地架在河上；他认为如果罪犯们已经跨过桥梁，渡过环绕高地周围的小河，为了小心起见，他们一定会把吊桥放下来，作为后退的余地的。
终于，透过树木之间的一个空隙，可以看见海平线了。大车还在继续前进，护送的人谁也不想把它扔下来。
这时候，潘克洛夫突然勒住野驴的缰绳，用沙哑的嗓音大叫道：
“啊！这些强盗！”
他指着前面，只见一股浓烟从磨坊、棚屋和家禽场的房舍那里升向天空。
在浓烟里，有一个人在行动。那是纳布。
伙伴们喊了一声。纳布听见以后，立刻向大家奔过来。
原来罪犯们破坏了高地，离开这里已经快半个钟头了！
“赫伯特先生呢？”纳布问道。
吉丁•史佩菜回到大车旁边来。
赫伯特已经昏迷过去了！
Book 3 Chapter 10
Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer. Herbert's critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the removal prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter could not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of the result. The cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some branches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the unconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Pencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.
What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for a moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur a few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his wounds. He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed. There was nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration? why was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this time, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been the theater.
It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who was watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of the pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was not enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get up to Granite House, where at least he was in safety.
But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the convicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn his master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the corral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th of November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days since Neb had had other news than that brought by Top--disastrous news: Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!
What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to fear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the buildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened him?
Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew the orang's great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof. Jup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced before him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven the cart thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The active orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of which the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.
Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup's neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,--
"Jup Jup! corral, corral!"
The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach, and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts' attention having been in the least excited.
"You did well, Neb," said Harding, "but perhaps in not warning us you would have done still better!"
And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery the removal had so seriously checked.
Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the beach. Not knowing the number of the island's inhabitants, they might suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have remembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave themselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,--plundering, burning, devastating everything,--and only retiring half an hour before the arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.
On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though in vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.
Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater misfortunes.
Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster.
It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of Granite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not have escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the other side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive any suspicious indications.
Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.
In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.
In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait on opportunity to recommence the attack.
It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert's condition. Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.
The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not suffered less.
The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a store of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.
As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable, the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters of the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.
Cyrus Harding's face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word. Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which still rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.
The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed on the island! Herbert's weakness visibly increased. It appeared that a more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological disturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!
In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists' disposal. The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at regular intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of December.
The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and tremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst intense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly five hours.
Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any cost before it should assume a more serious aspect.
"And in order to cure it," said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, "we need a febrifuge."
"A febrifuge--" answered the engineer. "We have neither Peruvian bark, nor sulphate of quinine."
"No," said Gideon Spilett, "but there are willows on the border of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a substitute for quinine."
"Let us try it without losing a moment," replied Cyrus Harding.
The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently necessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no means for extracting its essence.
Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and reduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to Herbert.
The night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return either during the following day.
Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.
It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert's liver became congested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was also affected.
Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the engineer aside.
"It is a malignant fever," said he.
"A malignant fever!" cried Harding. "You are mistaken, Spilett. A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must previously have existed."
"I am not mistaken," replied the reporter. "Herbert no doubt contracted the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a third, he is lost."
"But the willow bark?"
"That is insufficient," answered the reporter, "and the third attack of a malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always fatal."
Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would have gone mad.
It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered during the day of the 7th of December and the following night.
Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was terrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to die! The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft away.
The fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive a third.
The night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which went to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts, he called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious being,--that powerful unknown protector,--whose image was stamped upon his mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely prostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy was dead.
The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting fits. Herbert's thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from it.
"If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic febrifuge," said the reporter, "Herbert will be dead."
Night arrived--the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who was loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed against this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.
During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more violent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected, and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.
Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was exhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.
Towards three o'clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry. He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him, terrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.
Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.
All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.
It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in at the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this day was to be poor Herbert's last!
A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.
Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.
On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these words:-- "SULPHATE OF QUININE."
现在移民们不再考虑罪犯们给“花岗石宫”所带来的危害和高地所遭到的破坏了。赫伯特的病情十分危急，大家没有心思顾及其他的事情。这次移动的结果会不会引起致命的内伤呢？通讯记者不敢断定，可是他和他的伙伴们几乎已经绝望了。大车来到河道拐弯的地方。他们用树枝做了一个担架，把不省人事的赫伯特连垫子一起放在上面。十分钟以后，赛勒斯•史密斯、史佩莱和潘克洛夫来到了峭壁下，让纳布把大车带到眺望岗的高地上去。升降梯往上升起，不久以后，赫伯特就躺在“花岗石宫”里自己的床上了。
他们费尽了多少心机才使他苏醒过来。他醒来时发现已经在自己房间里了，干是他微微一笑，但是由于过度虚弱，他连一句话也说不出来。他的伤处本来就没有完全收口，吉丁•史佩莱怕创口重新迸发，就检查了一下，所幸创口并没有开裂。那么，怎么会产生这种虚脱现象的呢？赫伯特的病情怎么会恶化到这个程度的呢？刚检查完，少年就由于高烧而昏睡过去了。通讯记者和潘克洛夫一直没有离开他的床边。这时候，史密斯把畜栏里发生的事情全都告诉了纳布，纳布也向主人叙述了高地上发生的情况。
罪犯们只是在昨天夜里才在森林边缘甘油河的渡口出现的。当时纳布正在家禽场附近了望，他看见有一个海盗打算渡河。就毫不犹豫地放了一枪，可是在黑暗中，他不知道打中了没有。无论如何，匪徒们并没有被这一枪吓跑，纳布差点没来得及退到“花岗石宫”上去，在“花岗石宫”里他至少是安全的。
可是，他该怎么办呢？罪犯们眼看就要破坏高地了，怎样去阻止他们呢？他能想法子通知他的主人吗？此外，畜栏里的人当时处在什么情况之下呢？赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们是11月11日动身的，现在已经29日了。十九天来，纳布所得到的唯一的讯息，就是托普送来的坏消息：艾尔通失踪了，赫伯特身受重伤，工程师、通讯记者和水手被围困在畜栏里！
怎么办呢？可怜的纳布不禁要问自己。他本人并不怕什么，因为罪犯们是没法到“花岗石宫”上来的。可是他们的建筑物、农场和所有的布置都要任凭海盗们糟蹋了！要是能让赛勒斯•史密斯去考虑应该怎么办，至少让他知道可能遇到的危险，那样不是更好吗？
接着纳布想到可以利用杰普，就写了一封信让它带着。他知道猩猩非常聪明，这是许久以来就已证明了的。他们常向它提到“畜栏”，因此杰普懂得这两个字的意思，大家也许还记得，它经常陪潘克洛夫一起驾车到畜栏去。这时天还没有亮，机灵的猩猩会想法子偷偷地穿过森林的；再说即使罪犯们发现了它，也不过把它当作一个猩猩罢了。
纳布没有犹豫。他写好了信，系在杰普的脖子下面，然后把猩猩带到“花岗石宫”门口，把一根长绳子放到地面；接着，他重复了好几遍：
“杰普，杰普！畜栏，畜栏！”
猩猩明白了他的意思，它抓住绳子，敏捷地滑到海滩上，随后就在黑暗中消失了，丝毫也没有惊动罪犯们。
“做得对，纳布，”史密斯说，“可是，假如不通知我们，也许要更好一些！”
赛勒斯•史密斯所以这样说，是因为想到了赫伯特，由于这次迁移，严重地妨碍了他的复原。
纳布讲完了。罪犯们一个也没有到沙滩上来。他们摸不清岛上有多少人，也许还以为有一个相当大的部队在防卫“花岗石宫”呢。他们一定还记得：在双桅船进攻的时候，山石的高处和低处，都有很多的枪弹向他们打来；他们一定认为这些人现在是有意不暴露行踪。可是眺望岗的高地却没有“花岗石宫”的炮火掩护，他们可以随便上去。于是他们就大肆破坏起来，他们抢劫、放火、捣毁一切，直到移民们回来以前半小时，才离开高地。当时他们以为移民们还困守在畜栏里呢。
他们走了以后，纳布急忙跑出来。他冒着暴露自己甚至被打死的危险，爬上高地，想扑灭吞没家禽场建筑物的火焰；虽然并没有什么效果，但他还是坚持和大火斗争，直到大车来到森林的边缘时才住手。
这就是事情的经过。罪犯们的存在，永远是林肯岛居民的一个危险的祸根。他们过去一直生活得非常愉快，可是从现在起，却可能还要遭到更大的不幸。
史佩莱和潘克洛夫留在“花岗石宫”里，和赫伯特在一起，赛勒斯•史密斯在纳布的陪伴下，要亲自去看一下这次破坏波及的范围。
侥幸的是，罪犯们没有到“花岗石宫”的脚下来。否则“石窟”的工场就难免要遭到破坏了。可是，从另一方面说，即使“石窟”遭到破坏，比起眺望岗来，所受的损失还是比较容易弥补的。史密斯和纳布向慈悲河走去，爬上河的左岸，并没有发现罪犯的踪迹；在河的对岸和丛林深处，也没有发现任何可疑的迹象。
现在大致有两种可能：一种可能是罪犯们在畜栏路上看见居民，知道他们回“花岗石宫”了；另一种可能是他们破坏了高地以后，就深入啄木鸟林，沿着慈悲河逃跑了，因此不知道居民们回来。
如果是第一种情况，他们一定又回畜栏去了，因为那里现在没有人防守，却有许多贵重的东西。
如果是第二种情况，他们一定回到了他们安身的地方，等待机会，准备重新进攻。
因此，居民们如果采取守势，是不成问题的。可是现在任何进一步肃清岛上匪徒的计划，都由于赫伯特的病情而搁浅了。的确，虽然以他们的全部力量来说，还勉强能对付这帮罪犯，可是现在谁也离不开“花岗石宫”。
工程师和纳布来到了高地。到处是一片荒凉的景象。田地被践踏了，眼看就要成熟的麦穗倒在地上。农场的其他部分也遭到了同样的损失。
菜园也被破坏了。幸而“花岗石宫”里还保存着一部分种籽，以后是能够把菜园恢复起来的。
家禽场的外壁和建筑物，以及野驴的厩房，都被大火烧毁了。一些受惊的动物在高地上彷徨着。焚烧时躲在湖上的飞禽，又回到老地方来，正在岸边戏水。一切都可以重新建设起来。
赛勒斯•史密斯的脸色显得比平时苍白，他感到很难压下心头的怒气，可是他一句话也没有说。他又看了一眼破坏了的田地和火场里还在往上升的余烟，然后回“花岗石宫”去了。
以后的几天是移民们在荒岛上所过的最悲痛的日子！赫伯特显然变得更虚弱了。看样子好象是由于严重的生理失调，而将要暴发一种更厉害的疾病。史佩莱担心自己没有力量和这种恶化的病势进行斗争！
事实上，赫伯特几乎一直在昏迷状态中，神经错乱的症状也开始出现了。移民们唯一的药品就是清凉的饮料。热度现在还不太高，可是不久以后，大概就要每隔一个时期发一次烧了。果然，12月6日那天，吉丁•史佩莱第一次发现这种情况。
可怜的少年手指和耳鼻都变得十分惨白，起初他微微有些打颤，浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩，不住地哆嗦着。他的脉搏既微弱又不正常，皮肤非常干燥，他感到口渴得厉害。然后马上就是一阵痉挛；他的脸上发着高烧，皮肤通红，脉搏也加快了，然后出了一身大汗，热度好象也随着降低了。这一阵发作几乎持续了五个钟头。
吉丁•史佩莱始终没有离开赫伯特。很明显，少年染上疟疾了。必须不惜任何代价进行医疗，以免病况进入更加严重的局面。
“要想把病医好，”史佩莱对赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们必须取得一种退热药。”
“一种退热药……”工程师说，“我们既没有奎宁树皮，也没有硫酸奎宁，不是吗？”
“不错，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“可是湖边有柳树，也许柳树皮可以作奎宁的代用品。”
“我们赶快抓紧时间试试吧。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
的确，柳树皮和七叶树皮、冬青树叶以及蛇根草等一样，巳经被合理地当作奎宁皮的代用药了。它虽然没有奎宁皮那样名贵，显然还是有必要试一试的。由于没法提取它的精华，他们只好不经过加工就拿来使用。
赛勒斯•史密斯从一棵黑柳树上削下几片树皮，带回“花岗石宫”，把它们捣成碎末，当晚就让赫伯特吃下去了。
这一夜没有发生什么重大变化，就这样过去了。赫伯特的神经有些错乱，可是夜里并没有发烧，第二天白天热度也没有上升。
潘克洛夫又恢复希望了。吉丁•史佩莱却什么也没有说。也许发烧不是每天的，而是隔日一次，要再过一天才会复发，因此，他万分焦急地等待着下一天。
有一点可以看得出，在这期间，赫伯特完全陷入了虚脱状态，他的头部无力而眩晕。还有一个症状使通讯记者大吃一惊，赫伯特的肝脏充血了，不久以后，他的神经错乱得更加厉害，说明他的大脑也受了影响。
吉丁•史佩莱对这个新的共发症简直毫无办法。他把工程师拉在一旁。
“这是一种恶性疟疾。”他说。
“恶性疟疾！”史密斯叫道。“你错了，史佩莱。恶性疟疾不会自发产生的；一定要事先有这种病菌潜伏着才能够发病。”
“我没有弄错，”通讯记者说。“赫伯特一定是在荒岛的沼泽地带感染上这种病菌的。他已经发作了一次；如果再发一次，而我们又没法防止第三次的话，他就要完了。”
“可是柳树皮呢？”
“那不顶用，”通讯记者答道，“如果不用奎宁防止恶性疟疾的第三次发作，那是一定要丧命的。”
幸亏潘克洛夫没有听见这场谈话，要不然他真要疯了。
12月7日的白天和这一夜晚，工程师和通讯记者多么着急是不难想象的。
将近中午的时候，第二次发作又来了。这一关是非常可怕的。赫伯特觉得自己瘫痪下去了。他把胳膊伸给赛勒斯•史密斯、史佩莱和潘克洛夫。小小的年纪就要死去，未免太早了！这真是令人心碎的一个场面。他们只好把潘克洛夫打发到别处去。
痉挛延续了五个钟头。很明显，赫伯特再也经不起第三次的打击了。
这一夜是凄惨可怕的。在神经错乱的状态中，赫伯特含含糊糊地说了几句话，这几句话打动了伙伴们的心弦。原来他在和罪犯们斗争，他叫唤着艾尔通，他不断地恳求那个神秘的人——那个神通广大的不知名的保卫者，他的形象已经铭记在赫伯特的脑海里了。然后，他耗尽了体力，又陷入了完全虚脱的状态。有几次吉丁•史佩莱以为这个可怜的少年已经死了。
第二天是12月8日，赫伯特成天在昏迷的痉挛状态中度过。他那骨瘦如柴的双手紧紧地抓着床上的被单。他们又给他吃了一些捣碎的树皮末，可是通讯记者并没有抱什么希望。
“如果在明天一早以前还没有比较有效的退热药给他吃，”通讯记者说，“赫伯特就非死不可了。”
黑夜来临了，这可能是这位善良、勇敢而又聪明的少年的最后一夜了。以他的年龄来说，他在哪方面都显得出类拔萃，人人都象爱护自己的孩子一样地喜爱他；然而今天晚上，他的命运太难令人乐观了。唯一能够医治这种可怕的恶性疟疾的药品，唯一能够起死回生的特效药，却不是林肯岛上所能找到的。
12月8日夜间，赫伯特精神错乱得更加严重。肝脏充血达到可怕的程度，大脑也受到了感染，他已经认不清任何人了。
病情第三次发作时，他肯定是要死了。他还能活到第二天吗？恐怕不能了。他已经耗尽了体力，在发烧的间歇期间，他就象死人似的躺在那里。
夜里三点钟的时候，赫伯特发出一声尖叫，好象是由于极度的痉挛撕裂了他的身体似的。纳布当时离他不远，听见以后吓了一跳，急忙向伙伴们所在的房间里跑去。
这时候，托普也莫名其妙地大叫起来。
大家急忙冲进屋去，想使垂死的少年平静下来。这时赫伯特几乎要滚下床铺，史佩莱抓住他的胳膊，感到他的脉搏逐渐加快了。
这时候是早上五点钟。初升的太阳开始照进“花岗石宫”的窗户。它告诉人们，这是一个晴朗的日子，可是这却是可怜的赫伯特的最后一天了：
一线阳光照亮了床边的一张桌子。
潘克洛夫突然指着桌子上的一件东西，惊叫一声。
桌上放着一个长方形的匣子，标签上写着：
“硫酸奎宁”。
Book 3 Chapter 11
Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to his lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.
This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came there might be discussed later.
"Some coffee!" said Spilett.
In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture.
There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had not yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would not return!
Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment, when they had despaired of it.
In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than ever. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into Granite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of the genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius himself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours.
The next day some improvement in Herbert's condition was apparent. Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were animated by returning hope.
This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December, Herbert's convalescence commenced.
He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no access of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such docility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!
Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss. Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace. Since then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.
The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.
"We will find him!" repeated the sailor.
Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!
The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which the colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried. They commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and a tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert's recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of Granite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which could not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!
"It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!" said Pencroft.
During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer and Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions did not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered, the expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be undertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all the strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain satisfaction from the convicts.
However, Herbert's convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely healed.
During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau of Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The grain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for the approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard, wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his companions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very probably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. when the island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding. The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength visibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen years of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and commanding presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring care,--and Dr. Spilett was very strict,--made rapid progress. Towards the end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect Heights, and the beach.
He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with Pencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought he might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of February was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would be favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the island.
The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and were important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite House until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to exterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on the other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the fortunes of the colony.
Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast from Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.
They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the left bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the north, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed. Consequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations.
It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of the Mercy.
It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral, where it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge, either to pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the devastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by this time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the convicts' interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be still time to go and turn them out on their return.
Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place Granite House in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.
The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a long journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it was necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about the woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever.
It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top and Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible dwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure, was consecrated entirely to repose, and--thanksgiving addressed by the colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert, who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were formerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the colonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and nothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite House in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down, left no communication between the upper landing and the beach.
The weather was magnificent.
"We shall have a warm day of it," said the reporter, laughing.
"Pooh! Dr. Spilett," answered Pencroft, "we shall walk under the shade of the trees and shan't even see the sun!"
"Forward!" said the engineer.
The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter made Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor's orders.
Neb placed himself at the onagers' heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert offered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony. The moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.
The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers, leaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods which formed the region of the Far West.
For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the colonists.
The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground. Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees, and other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could reach. The feathered tribes of the island were all represented--grouse, jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos, parrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly at their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first excursions they had made on their arrival at the island.
"Nevertheless," observed Cyrus Harding, "I notice that these creatures, both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods have, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly find some traces of them."
And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or less recent, of the passage of a band of men--here branches broken off the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a settled encampment.
The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who were, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would necessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous to leave unguarded.
In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House, their progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before entering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the evening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the soil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal, for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that the night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames, and it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night.
The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were to watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett in one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns over the camp.
The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun. The silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate Master Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the 15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than difficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than six miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their hatchets.
Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the small ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a very winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.
During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out like the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of which the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp of excellent flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of magnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet. These were the tree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.
As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to the hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong to the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was their speed.
As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some footprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were attentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the other, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men's feet were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot; but,--and this was the object of so minute an examination,--a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that case would have been that of Ayrton.
"Ayrton was not with them!" said Herbert.
"No," answered Pencroft, "and if he was not with them, it was because the wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a den to which they may be tracked like tigers!"
"No," replied the reporter, "it is more probable that they wander at random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they will be masters of the island!"
"The masters of the island!" exclaimed the sailor; "the masters of the island!..." he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, "Do you know, Captain Harding," said he, "what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?"
"No, Pencroft!"
"It is the ball that went through Herbert's chest, and I promise you it won't miss its mark!"
But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas! conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.
That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus Harding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from Reptile Point.
And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor that, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.
吉丁•史佩莱拿起匣子，把它打开。匣子里盛着约有二百克莱因的白色粉末。他尝了一点。味道很苦；于是一切怀疑都打消了，毫无疑问，这就是提炼过的宝贵的奎宁，最有效的退热剂。
必须毫不耽搁地让赫伯特把这种药粉吃下去。至于它是怎么来的，不妨以后再讨论。
“准备一些咖啡！”史佩莱说。
不一会儿，纳布端来一杯温热的咖啡。吉丁•史佩莱在里面加了大约十八克莱因的奎宁。他们顺利地给赫伯特喂完了这种混合液体。
时间还赶得上，恶性疟疾第三次还没有发作。他们多么盼望它从此就不再发作了啊：
必须附带说明，现在人人都又充满希望了。在这紧要关头，当大家都已经绝望了的时候，神秘的力量又发挥了它的作用。
几个钟头以后，赫伯特平静得多了。现在居民们可以讨论一下这件事情。陌生人的支援变得比以前任何一次都明显。可是，他怎么能在夜里深入“花岗石宫”的呢？这是不可思议的。岛上这位圣人的行动简直和他本人一样神秘。这一天，他们每隔三个钟头就让赫伯特吃一次硫酸奎宁。
第二天，赫伯特的病情显著好转了。当然，他还没有脱离危险，疟疾这种病往往会复发，只要复发起来就是危险的，可是大家对他照顾得无微不至。此外，现在手头还有特效药，送药的人无疑又不在远处！于是大家的希望又重新浮现出来了。
他们这次并没有失望。十天以后，从12月20日起，赫伯特开始复原了。
他的身体还很虚弱，只是不再转入发烧的状况了。大家对他的饮食给予严格的限制。可怜的孩子多么自觉听话，遵守一切的规定！他多么希望早日痊愈啊！
潘克洛夫就象一个刚刚被从深渊里挽救出来的人似的，他高兴得简直要发狂了。在预计该有第三次发作的时间过去以后，他紧紧的抱住通讯记者，几乎使他连气也透不过来。从此以后，他就把通讯记者叫做史佩莱医生了。
然而，真正的医生还是没有发现。
“我们一定要找到他！”水手一再地说。
不管这个人是谁，肯定地说，一旦被好心的潘克洛夫找到以后，准会得到十二万分热烈的拥抱的！
1867年随着十二月份过去了，在这一年的年底，移民们遭到了严重的考验。1868年开始的时候，天气晴朗，气候仿佛是热带那么炎热，幸而有海风吹来，才令人感到凉爽些。赫伯特的健康正在恢复。他的床就在“花岗石宫”的一个窗口，他可以呼吸到含有臭氧的新鲜空气，这对恢复他的健康，是有极大作用的。他的胃口也恢复了，纳布给他准备了多少鲜美可口的菜肴啊！
“给预备这么多好吃的东西，谁都想得疟疾了！”潘克洛夫说。
在这期间，罪犯们始终没有在“花岗石宫”附近出现。艾尔通也没有下落，虽然工程师和赫伯特还希望能够重新找到他，他们的伙伴却都认为这个不幸的人已经死了。无论如何，这个疑问是不会存在太久的，只要少年复原以后，就可以远征了。远征的结果将会有非常重大意义的。为了向罪犯们讨还血债，就必须出动小队的全部力量，因此，他们也许还要等一个月。
可是，赫伯特的健康恢复得很快，肝脏已经不再充血，创伤也基本上收口了。
在一月份中，眺望岗的高地上进行了重要的工作：工作的内容只有一样，就是把劫后的庄稼，不管是小麦还是菜蔬，尽量贮藏起来。他们捡了许多麦粒和植物，准备在未来的半个季度中重新播种。关于家禽场的外壁和厩房的修复工作，赛勒斯•史密斯打算过一个时期再做。因为当他和他的伙伴们出发追踪的时候，罪犯们很可能再度光临高地；给他们创造一个第二次破坏的机会，那实在太不必要了。他们可以等到把岛上的匪徒肃清以后，再着手修复。在一月份的第二个星期里，少年开始下床了；最初他每天起来一个钟头，然后是两个钟头，三个钟头。由于他的体质健壮，体力恢复起来也很快。他今年十八岁，身材很高，一看就知道将来会长成一个相貌堂堂的男子汉。从这时候起，他的健康——史佩莱严格地指出还需要休养——迅速地恢复起来。月底的时候，赫伯特已经能在眺望岗和海滩上散步了。
他和潘克洛夫、纳布一块洗过几次海水浴，结果好处很大。赛勒斯•史密斯觉得现在时机已经成熟，就决定在2月15日动身。在一年的这个季节，夜晚非常清朗，这对搜索整个的海岛是有利的。
于是开始进行准备远征的必要工作了。这项工作非常重要，因为移民们已经下定决心，不达到他们的双重目标，决不回“花岗石宫”。他们一方面要歼灭罪犯——如果艾尔通没有死，还要把他救出来；另一方面，还要找出这个真正掌握着小队命运的，究竟是什么人。
在林肯岛上，居民们彻底了解的地方有：从爪角到颚骨角之间整个的东海岸，宽阔的潦凫沼地，格兰特湖的周围，畜栏路和慈悲河之间的啄木鸟林，慈悲河流域和红河流域，最后，还有富兰克林山的支脉——建立畜栏的那个地方。
还有一些地方，虽然知道得不太彻底，但也探索过了，那就是：从爪角到爬虫角之间华盛顿湾的宽阔海岸，西边的沼泽森林海岸，和一直绵延到鲨鱼湾港口的看不到边的沙丘。除了上面所说的地方以外，覆盖盘蛇半岛的森林，慈悲河右边的整个地区，瀑布河的左岸，以及支撑富兰克林山麓东、西、北三面支脉与山谷的荒野，他们都没有探索过；毫无疑问，这里会有许多隐蔽的地方。照这样估计，岛上还有上千英亩的地方没有考察过。
因此，他们决定深入远西地带去探险，并且搜索慈悲河右边的整个地区。
也许最好还是直接到畜栏去，因为罪犯们为了抢劫，或是为了安身，可能又躲到那里去了。可是现在有两种情形：一种是罪犯已经把畜栏破坏了，要想去阻止也来不及；另一种就是罪犯们还坚守在里面。如果是第二种情形的话，等到回来的时候再赶他们也不迟。
经过讨论以后，他们决定采用第一个计划：穿过森林，到爬虫角去。他们要用斧头开路，草草地开辟出一条十六到十七英里长的道路轮廓，从“花岗石宫”一直通到半岛的末端。
大车完好无损。野驴休息了很长时间，可以参加远征。食品、露营用具、轻便火炉和各种器皿都包好装在大车上。“花岗石宫”的兵器库在目前来说相当完善了，他们从里面仔细挑选了一些火药和武器。有一点必须记住，罪犯们也许就在森林里游荡；如果走在密林深处，很可能被冷枪打中。因此，居民们决定要集体行动，不管什么理由，都不准离开。
大家还决定，“花岗石宫”里一个人也不留。连托普和杰普都随同参加远征。这所外人上不去的住宅是不需要留守的。2月14日是动身的前夕，这一天是星期日。移民们休息了一整天，并且做了祈祷。他们看到少年虽然已经完全恢复了健康，但身体总还是弱一些，就在大车里安排了一个位子给他坐。赛勒斯•史密斯为了防止“花岗石宫”受到侵略，就在第二天破晓以后作了一些必要的安排。过去用来攀登的梯子，拿到“石窟”去了。他们把它深深地埋在沙地里，准备回来的时候用，因为升降梯的机械都一块一块地卸开了，全套装置拆得一点也不剩。最后只剩潘克洛夫一个人留在“花岗石宫”里进行这项工作。拆完以后，他用一根分成两股的绳子，下面由人拉着，从上面系下来。只要绳子一扯下来，上面的平台和海滩之间就断绝交通了。
这一天天气很好。
“今天够暖和的。”通讯记者笑道。
“嘿！史佩莱医生，”潘克洛夫说，“我们可以在树荫下走，保险连太阳都看不见！”
“走吧！”工程师说。
大车在“石窟”前的海滩上等着。通讯记者让赫伯特上了车，要他至少在头几个钟头的旅途中坐车行进。少年只好听医生的话。
出发的时候已到，小队动身了。纳布牵着野驴前进。赛勒斯•史密斯、通讯记者和水手在车前面走。托普一路高兴地蹦蹦跳跳。赫伯特在车里找了一个位子给杰普，杰普毫不客气地坐了下来。
大车首先绕过慈悲河的拐角，翻过左岸向前走了一英里，然后过桥；桥这边就是通往气球港的大路。探险家们从路口往右拐去，进入了遍布森林的远西地带。
最初两英里之内，树木稀疏，大车可以顺利通行；只是常常需要斩断一些爬藤和灌木，在这一段路途中，移民们还没有遇到严重的障碍。
浓密的枝叶阴影投在地面上，构成一片恰合人意的树荫。喜马拉雅杉、洋松、“加苏林那”树、山茂、橡皮树、龙血树，和其他许多有名的品种，一棵接着一棵，一眼望不到头。岛上的各种鸟类这里应有尽有：山鸡、啄木鸟、雉、猩猩、鹦鹉，以及叽叽喳喳乱叫的美冠鹦鹉、鹦鹉和长尾鹦鹉。刺鼠、袋鼠和水豚看见人们走近，就飞也似的逃跑了，这一切都勾起居民们的回忆，他们想起了来到岛上以后第一次打猎时的情景。
“可是，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我发现这些飞禽走兽都比过去胆小了。从这点看来，罪犯们最近曾经从这部分森林里走过，我们一定可以找到他们的踪迹的。”
果然，他们找到几处象有一小队人在最近通过的足迹，有的地方大概是为了沿路做记号，把树枝折断了；有的地方留下一堆灰烬，粘土地上还有一些脚印；可是找不到任何露宿的迹象。
工程师已经指示大家不要打猎了。也许罪犯们就在森林里，一开枪就要惊动他们。而且要打猎就必须离开大车，走出一段距离。留下大车没人看管是非常危险的。
下半天，离开“花岗石宫”六英里的光景，前进困难得多了。为了穿过密林，他们不得不砍去一些树木。在走进这种地方以前，史密斯总是很仔细地先让托普和杰普进去，它们忠实地执行任务，如果它们不作任何警告地回来，就可以断定这里没有任何危险，既没有罪犯，又没有野兽。这二者同样属于动物界，凶残的本性是半斤八两的。第一天晚上，移民们在离“花岗石宫”九英里左右的地方露宿，近旁有一条小溪流入慈悲河，他们从来不知道有这条小溪，而它的水路系统使土壤变得十分肥沃，这是可以肯定的。居民们肚子饿了，就饱餐了一顿，然后安排怎样平安过夜。如果工程师只需要对付野兽，例如美洲豹或其他兽类，那只要在帐篷周围点起火来，就足够防御它们了；可是有了罪犯，他们不但不会被营火惊走，相反地，恐怕还会被招引过来。考虑结果，最好还是让自己包围在漆黑的夜色里。
他们小心地组织了守夜的工作。大家一致同意两个人一班担任警戒，每隔两个钟头换班一次。尽管赫伯特一再提出，居民们还是不让他守夜。于是，潘克洛夫和吉丁•史佩莱一班，工程师和纳布一班，就这样在营地周围站岗放哨了。
夜晚仅仅是几个钟头，与其说是由于没有太阳而造成的，还不如说是由于枝叶过分浓密而造成的黑暗。森林里非常寂静，只是有时传来几声美洲豹的怒吼和猿猴的叫声。小杰普似乎特别不爱听猴子叫。这一夜平安无事地度过了。第二天2月16日，继续在森林中穿行，旅途中虽然有困难，但更令人烦恼的却是一路上枯燥无味的感觉。这一天他们走了不到六英里，因为时间大都浪费在用斧头开路上面了。
移民们就象定居在这里的人一样，仅仅砍倒一些小树，把那些高大而美丽的树木保留下来；当然，不砍大树也是因为需要花许多劳动力才能砍倒的缘故。可是这么一来，道路就格外弯曲。由于转弯抹角的地方很多，大大地延长了他们的路程。
这一天，赫伯特发现了几种以前在岛上没有遇到过的新植物品种，例如叶子象泉水似的四面披开的桫椤和刺槐。刺槐上除了结有野驴特别爱吃的长荚以外，还有一种香甜可口的果肉。在这里，移民们又发现了几丛雄伟的卡利松。它们的树干是圆柱形的，顶上有一簇锥形的绿叶，树身高达二百英尺。卡利松是新西兰的万树之王，和黎巴嫩的杉树一样远近闻名。
至于动物方面，除了猎人们已经见过的以外，没有其他的品种了。然而，虽然没法接近，他们却看见一对澳洲所特有的大飞禽。这是一种名叫鸸鹋的食火鸡，身高五尺，长有褐色的羽毛，属于涉水鸟类。托普撒开四条腿，拚命向它们赶去，可是鸸鹋奔走的速度很快，一眨眼就把它抛在后面了。
至于罪犯们留下的遗迹，他们另外还发现一些。有一堆余烬显然是最近才熄灭的，在它附近有一些脚印。居民们仔细地检查了一下。他们一一测量了脚印的长度和宽度，很容易看出来这是五个人的脚印。这五个罪犯一定曾在这里露宿过。如果有第六个人的脚印，那一定是艾尔通的，可是，他们经过仔细研究，并没有发现第六个人的脚印。
“艾尔通没有和他们在一起！”赫伯特说。
“不错，”潘克洛夫说，“既然不在一起，那一定是已经被匪徒们杀死了！这些流氓连个窝也没有，要不然我们可以象追老虎似的追逐他们！”
“不错，”通讯记者说，“他们大概一直在各处漫无目的地漂荡，打算直到成为岛上的主人为止！”
“岛上的主人！”水手大声叫道；“岛上的主人！……”他重复着，好象有一只铁爪扼住了他的喉咙似的，他连话也说不出来了。然后他说：“史密斯先生，”这时他的声音平静一些了，“你知道我的枪里装的是一颗什么子弹吗？”
“不知道，潘克洛夫！”
“就是打透赫伯特胸膛的那颗子弹，我向你保证，一定要用它打中目标！”
可是不管这个报复多么公平合理，也已经不能使艾尔通复活了。察看了遗留在地上的脚印以后，他们只能得出这样的结论：再也不能希望和他重新见面了。
当天晚，上，他们在离“花岗石宫”十四英里的地方露宿。赛勒斯•史密斯估计他们离爬虫角已经不到五英里了。
果然，第二天他们到达了半岛的尽头。森林的纵长方向全走完了，可是他们并没有找到罪犯们藏身的地方，也同样没有找到神秘的陌生人的秘密住处。
Book 3 Chapter 12
The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration of all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls River. The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as it was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island. One might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or Africa had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them to conclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in its upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which could not belong to a temperate climate. The most frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.
But the colonists' object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would have been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which the first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their island no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the last man.
No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully sought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more deserted camps.
"This does not surprise me," said Cyrus Harding to his companions. "The convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam Point, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after crossing Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we took on leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the wood. But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they would discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going northwards again, they came upon the corral."
"Where they have perhaps returned," said Pencroft.
"I do not think so," answered the engineer, "for they would naturally suppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment."
"I am of Cyrus' opinion," said the reporter, "and I think that it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their lair."
"Then, captain, straight to the corral!" cried Pencroft. "We must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!"
"No, my friend," replied the engineer; "you forget that we have a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some habitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of gratitude to perform."
"That was well said, captain," replied the sailor, "but, all the same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases."
And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable that the stranger's retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.
That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was organized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.
The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore, where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already partly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the west coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.
The engineer's plan was this:--To minutely survey the valley forming the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations which had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.
This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were impatient to regain entire possession of their island.
They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river's bank, became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not venture without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented--nothing announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of trees still hid it.
It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it was occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait until night came on.
However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience, volunteered to accompany him.
"No, my friends," said the engineer, "wait till night. I will not allow one of you to expose himself in open day."
"But, captain--" answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.
"I beg of you, Pencroft," said the engineer.
"Very well!" replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.
The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched the neighboring parts of the forest.
Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence reigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a footstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would have been heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying on the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of uneasiness. At eight o'clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding consented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.
"Do not be imprudent," said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, "you have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is occupied or not."
"All right," answered Pencroft.
And the two departed.
Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty feet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound, advanced with great caution.
They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a less mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment to hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett and Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade.
They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of trees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared to be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that any imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims, would fall afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were killed, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?
But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.
"In a few minutes it will be quite dark," whispered Spilett in the sailor's ear, "then will be the time to act."
Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his energies, and waited, swearing to himself.
Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if it issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin rose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night spread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was the time.
The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to be absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a little darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number to guard against any surprise.
Spilett grasped his companion's hand, and both crept towards the corral, their guns ready to fire.
They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single ray of light.
Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had supposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the outer bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the convicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had fastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.
Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.
Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the goats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of night.
The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether they had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral. This would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding's instructions.
It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail. Now, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of the expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance of surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades?
This was not the reporter's opinion. He thought it better to wait until all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate into the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be guarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return to the cart, where they would consult.
Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood.
In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs.
"Well," said he, after a little thought, "I now have reason to believe that the convicts are not in the corral."
"We shall soon know," said Pencroft, "when we have scaled the palisade."
"To the corral, my friends!" said Cyrus Harding.
"Shall we leave the cart in the wood?" asked Neb.
"No," replied the engineer, "it is our wagon of ammunition and provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment."
"Forward, then!" said Gideon Spilett.
The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready to fire. Jup, at Pencroft's orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash, to prevent him from bounding forward.
The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating, the little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the dangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers' heads to hold them. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was open!
"What do you say now?" asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and Spilett.
Both were stupefied.
"I can swear," said Pencroft, "that this gate was shut just now!"
The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when Pencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be doubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them. Were they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?
All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists, but how could they be answered?
At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding's hand.
"What's the matter?" asked the engineer.
"A light!"
"In the house?"
"Yes!"
All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw glimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. "It is our only chance," said he to his companions, "of finding the convicts collected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power! Forward!" The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their guns ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the charge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.
Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral.
In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.
Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window, then feebly lighted by the inner light.
He gazed into the apartment.
On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used by Ayrton.
On the bed lay the body of a man.
Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--"Ayrton!" he exclaimed.
Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists rushed into the room.
Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great bruises.
Harding bent over him.
"Ayrton!" cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had just found again under such unexpected circumstances.
At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then at the others,--
"You!" he cried, "you?"
"Ayrton! Ayrton!" repeated Harding.
"Where am I?"
"In the house in the corral!"
"Alone?"
"Yes!"
"But they will come back!" cried Ayrton. "Defend yourselves! defend yourselves!"
And he fell back exhausted.
"Spilett," exclaimed the engineer, "we may be attacked at any moment. Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come back here."
Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer's orders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was in the hands of the convicts!
In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling sullenly.
The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire. Herbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking the corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock the settlers over one after the other.
At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of the forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the enclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which watered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From the side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood out white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the enclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart entering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars.
But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and rush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.
"Be ready to fire, my friends!" cried Harding.
The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.
Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill cries.
The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little stream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!
They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed on Lincoln Island!
第二天，2月18日，移民们准备探索从爬虫角到瀑布河沿岸一带的森林地区。这一带森林在盘蛇半岛的两岸之间，宽不过三四英里，是可以彻底进行搜索的。这里的树木不但高大，而且枝叶茂盛。可以看得出来，这一带的土壤比荒岛的其他各地肥沃得多。人们也许会以为是从美洲或非洲迁移到这个温带地区来的一部分原始森林。他们推断的结果，认为这些壮丽的树木所生长的地方土壤一定比较热。原来这里的土壤表层潮湿，而内部却由于火山的烈焰，使温度升高了；这种温度在温带气候里，是不可能有的。这一带常见的树木是高大的卡利松和有加利树。
当然，居民们的目的并不仅仅是欣赏优美的林木。他们知道，在这方面林肯岛已经有资格列入最初被称为“快乐群岛”的加那利的第一流岛屿之中了。可是，令人叹息的是，林肯岛已经不完全归他们所有了！已经有匪徒侵占了它，玷污了它的海岸，必须把这帮匪徒消灭得干干净净！
他们搜索得非常仔细，西海岸并没有发现丝毫痕迹。这里连脚印、断技和残留的营地都没有了。
“这一点我倒并不感到奇怪，”赛勒斯•史密斯对他的伙伴们说。“罪犯们最初在荒岛的遗物角附近登陆，穿过潦凫沼地以后，他们立刻深入了远西森林。然后他们几乎是循着我们从‘花岗石宫’出发以后所走的道路前进的。这就是我们能在森林里发现踪迹的原因。可是罪犯们从登岸以后很快就发现这一带没有适合居住的地方，因此，才又往北去，以致被他们找到了畜栏。”
“也许他们已经回畜栏去了。”潘克洛夫说。
“我想没有，”工程师说，“因为他们一定会认为我们要向那个方向搜索的。对他们说来，畜栏仅仅是个仓库，而不是可以长期逗留的地方。”
“我同意赛勒斯的看法，”通讯记者说，“我想，罪犯们一定把老窝扎在富兰克林山的支脉之间了。”
“那么，史密斯先生，立刻到畜栏去！”潘克洛夫叫道。“我们一定要把他们杀光。到现在为止，我们完全是在浪费时间！”
“不，我的朋友，”工程师说，“你忘了我们还想知道远西森林里有没有住宅了。我们的远征是有双重目标的，潘克洛夫。一方面我们固然要惩治罪犯，另一方面，我们还要报答别人的恩惠。”
“说得对，史密斯先生，”水手说，“可是怎么都一样，我认为在那位先生不愿意露面以前，我们是找不到他的。”
事实上，潘克洛夫一语道破了大家的想法。陌生人的住所大概正和他本人一样的神秘。
这天晚上，大车停在瀑布河口。他们照常组织了露宿，照常进行守夜。赫伯特现在已经又是一个健康而强壮的少年了。这种户外生活，既有海上吹来的微风，又有林间的新鲜空气，对他是有极大好处的。现在他不再坐在车上，而是走在小队的前面了。
第二天，2月19日，移民们离开海岸——在海岸的河口对面，各种玄武岩石堆砌在一起，形成一幅奇形怪状的图案——翻上河的左岸。过去他们常从畜栏到西海岸去，因此这条道路已经有一部分铺平了。居民们现在离富兰克林山还有六英里左右。
工程师的计划是这样的：仔细察看形成河床的山谷，小心向畜栏附近逼近；如果畜栏里有人，就用武力把它夺取过来；如果没有人，就坐守在里面，作为探索富兰克林山的前进据点。
移民们一致同意这个计划，因为他们都急着要光复他们的整个荒岛。
一道峡谷把富兰克林山的两个最大的支脉划分开来，他们就沿着这条峡谷向前走去。河岸上树木丛生，在稍微高些的山坡上就比较稀疏了。这里到处是崎岖的山地，打埋伏最为合适，因此他们前进时十分小心。托普和杰普在两旁的密林里跳来跳去，互相比赛着机智和灵活。夹岸一带没有任何迹象可以说明最近曾经有人来过，没有任何遗物说明这里或附近有罪犯存在。傍晚五点钟的时候，大车在离栅栏不到六百英尺的地方停住了。栅栏被一排围成半圆形的树林遮住了，因此还看不见。
现在必须侦察一下，确定畜栏里有没有人。罪犯们可能就隐藏在附近，如果白天大摇大摆向畜栏走去，那就会和可怜的赫伯特一样，等于送上去让匪徒们打，因此，最好还是等到天黑再说。
可是，吉丁•史佩菜却主张不再耽搁，立刻侦察畜栏的路径；潘克洛夫也忍耐不住了，他自告奋勇陪同通讯记者一起去。
“不，朋友们，”工程师说，“还是等到天黑再去吧。我决不让你们任何一个人在大白天暴露自己。”
“可是，史密斯先生……”水手还想不答应。
“我求求你，潘克洛夫。”工程师说。
“好！”水手说，他换了一种方法来发泄心头的愤怒，用船上人常用的最难听的话，辱骂那帮罪犯。
于是居民们留在大车旁边，小心地警戒着森林的周围。
三个钟头就这样过去了。风势减弱下来，大树底下鸦雀无声。即使是折断一根小树枝，脚踩在干枯的树叶上，或是身子从草地上滑一下，都可以听得清清楚楚。一切都是静悄悄的。托普趴在草地里，把头搁在爪子上，也没有表现出不安的样子。八点钟的时候，天色已经很晚，在这种情况下，一般是适合进行侦察的。吉丁•史佩莱表示随时准备和潘克洛夫出发。赛勒斯•史密斯同意了。托普和杰普留下来和工程师、赫伯特、纳布在一起，因为它们如果在不恰当的时候叫起来，是会惊动匪徒的。
“不要大意，”史密斯对通讯记者和潘克洛夫说，“你们不必占领畜栏，只要弄清楚里面有没有人就行了。”
“好。”潘克洛夫说。
于是他们两个人走了。
多亏枝叶茂密，树底下一片漆黑，三四十英尺以外，就什么都看不见了。通讯记者和潘克洛夫非常小心地前进着，一听到任何可疑的声音，马上就停下来。
他们彼此保持着一小段距离前进，这样目标就比较小了。老实说，他们随时都等待着枪声。离开大车五分钟以后，吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫来到森林边缘的空地前面，过了空地，就是畜栏的栅栏了。
他们停了下来。在这块没有树的空地上，还有几丝模糊不清的光线。三十英尺以外就是畜栏的大门，这时候门好象关着。从森林边缘到栅栏之间的这三十英尺是必须通过的，如果借用弹道学上的一个名词，不妨叫它“危险区”。事实上，不论谁闯入“危险区”，只要在栅栏后边放一两枪就可以把他打倒。吉丁•史佩莱和水手并不是临阵胆怯的人，可是他们也知道，如果不小心的话，不仅自己首先要成为牺牲品，而且还会影响他们的伙伴。如果他们被打死了，史密斯、纳布和赫伯特会怎么样呢？
潘克洛夫认为罪犯们一定已经在畜栏里住下了。现在距离畜栏这么近，他一时冲动，就想往前走。通讯记者一手将他牢牢地抓住。
“一会儿天就要黑透了，”史佩莱凑近水手的耳边低声说，“那时候再行动。”
潘克洛夫焦躁不安地握着枪托，尽量克制自己激动的心情，一面等待，一面低声诅咒。
不久，最后的一线余光消失了。黑暗好象从浓密的森林中间袭来，笼罩住了空地。富兰克林山仿佛一道庞大的屏障，屹立在西边的水平线上。纬度较低的地方照例是这样，夜色很快地来临。现在是时候了。
通讯记者和潘克洛夫到达森林边线以后，眼睛一直盯着栅栏。畜栏里似乎一个人也没有。栅栏的顶部形成一道直线，比周围的暗处稍微黑一些；可以看得很清楚，栅栏上并没有什么模糊的东西。如果罪犯们在畜栏里，他们一定会留一个人站岗，以防突然遭到袭击的。
史佩莱抓住伙伴的手，一起向畜栏匍匐前进；他们随时都准备开枪。
周围一片漆黑，连一线光也没有；这时候他们来到了畜栏的门口。
潘克洛夫打算把门推开，但是正和他们想象中一样，大门关着。水手发现外边的门闩并没有闩上，因此可以得出这样的结论：罪犯们在畜栏里，他们从里面把门关住，使外面推不开。
吉丁•史佩莱和潘克洛夫听了一会儿。
栅栏里一点声音也没有。摩弗仑羊和山羊一定在牲口棚里睡着了，因此丝毫也没有打破夜晚的宁静。
通讯记者和水手什么也没有听见，他们自己思忖着，是不是应该翻过栅栏，到畜栏里去。不，这样做就违背了赛勒斯•史密斯的指示。
的确，这样冒险是可能成功的，但也可能失败。如果罪犯们现在还没有任何怀疑，如果他们一点也不知道居民们进行远征来搜索他们，就是说，那是有进行突然袭击的机会的；如果轻率地越过栅栏就会失去这样的机会，是不是应该这样做呢？
通讯记者不打算这样。他认为最好还是等居民们聚齐了以后，再向畜栏进攻。有一点是肯定的：他们可以偷偷地走到栅栏前面，并且似乎也没有人在那里把守。这一点现在已经清楚了，就可以回到大车旁边去进行商讨，没有别的可做了。
潘克洛夫大概也同意这个决定，当通讯记者转回森林去的时候，他也不反对，就跟着回来了。
几分钟以后，工程师了解了当前的情况。
“好吧，”他想了一会儿，然后说，“我现在有理由认为，罪犯们不在畜栏里。”
“等我们翻过栅栏以后，”潘克洛夫说，“就可以证实了。”
“到畜栏里去，朋友们！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“我们就把大车留在森林里吗？”纳布问道。
“不，”工程师答道，“它是我们的军火和粮食车，必要的时候，还可以把它当堡垒用。”
“那么，前进！”吉丁•史佩莱说。
大车出了森林，静悄悄地向栅栏驶去。这时夜色非常昏暗，周围还是和刚才潘克洛夫与通讯记者爬行的时候一样，没有一点响动。满地都是杂草，因此行走时一点声音也没有。
移民们随时准备开枪。杰普听从潘克洛夫的话，独自留在后面。纳布用一根绳子拴着托普，不让它往前跑。
空地马上就出现在眼前了。这里一个人也没有。小队毫不犹豫地向栅栏走去。一会儿就走过“危险区”了。没有一声枪响。大车到达栅栏前面，停了下来。纳布在野驴前面勒住缰绳。工程师、通讯记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫向门口走去，看看究竟是不是从里面关的。
有一扇门开着！
“这是怎么一回事？”工程师向水手和史佩莱问道。
他们两个人都愣住了。
“我敢发誓，”潘克洛夫说，“这扇门刚才是关着的！”
居民们犹豫起来了。潘克洛夫和通讯记者侦察的时候，罪犯们在畜栏里吗？毫无疑问，当时他们是在里面的，因为既然门刚才还关着，那么只能是他们开的。可是现在他们还在里面吗？还是有一个匪徒刚出去呢？
所有这些问题都同时涌进了居民们的脑海，但是怎样才能解答这些问题呢？
赫伯特已经向栅栏走进去几步，这时候突然退回来，抓住工程师的手。
“怎么了？”工程师问道。
“有亮光！”
“屋子里头吗？”
“是的！”
五个人一起涌向前去。果然，只见面前的窗户里，有一线微弱的灯光闪动着。赛勒斯•史密斯很快地打定主意。“罪犯们没有怀疑会发生什么事情，他们聚在这个屋子里，现在正在我们的控制之下！这是我们唯一的机会！前进！”居民们手里端着枪，走进栅栏。大车留在外面让杰普和托普看管着。居民们已经小心地把它们拴在车上了。
赛勒斯•史密斯、潘克洛夫和吉丁•史佩莱在一边，赫伯特和纳布在另外一边，同时沿着栅栏，在漆黑冷清的畜栏里搜索前进。
他们不久就走近了关着的房门。
史密斯向伙伴们做了一个手势，教他们不要动。然后他走到被室内微弱的灯光照亮的窗子前面。
他向室内张望了一下。
桌上点着一盏灯。桌子旁边是艾尔通过去睡的床铺。
床上躺着一个人。
突然，赛勒斯•史密斯倒退几步，沙哑地喊道：
“艾尔通！”
居民们立刻闯进房门，冲到屋里去。
艾尔通好象睡着了。从他的脸色上可以看出，他曾经受过长期而残酷的折磨。他的腕部和踝部都有大片的伤痕。
史密斯向他弯下身来。
“艾尔通！”工程师抓住他的胳膊叫道。在这种情况下找到他，真是太想不到了。
艾尔通听见有人喊他，睁开两眼，呆呆地看看史密斯，又看看大家。
“你们！”他叫道，“是你们吗？”
“艾尔通！艾尔通！”史密斯重复地叫着。
“这是什么地方？”
“在畜栏的房子里！”
“只有我们吗？”
“是的！”
“可是他们要回来的！”艾尔通大声叫道。“你们快防备，快防备！”
然后他由于耗尽了体力，就晕过去了。
“史佩莱，”工程师大声说，“我们随时都可能遭到进攻。把大车拉到畜栏里来。然后闩上门，大家都回到这儿来。”
潘克洛夫、纳布和通讯记者急忙去执行工程师的命令。现在时间一刻也不能耽误。也许这时候大车已经落在罪犯们的手里了！
通讯记者和他的两个伙伴很快就穿过畜栏，来到栅栏门口。这时候托普正在栅栏外阴沉沉地咆哮着。
工程师暂时离开艾尔通，跑到外面来，准备开枪参加战斗。赫伯特也跟着他出来。他们都注意察看俯临畜栏的支脉顶峰。如果罪犯们埋伏在那里，他们是可以把居民们一个一个都打死的。
这时候，月亮从东方升了起来，悬挂在森林的黑幕上空。一片银白色的月光洒在栅栏里面。畜栏里繁茂的树木、作为水源的小溪和遍地的绿茵，转眼都照亮了。靠山的一边，房屋和一部分栅栏都浸浴在皎洁的月光里。只有对门的栅栏还保持着阴暗。
不久以后，一团漆黑的东西出现了。那就是大车，它逐渐进入了月光照耀的范围内。当伙伴们关门和上闩的时候，赛勒斯•史密斯听见门上传来了响声。
这时候，托普突然挣脱了束缚，一面愤怒地狂叫，一面向畜栏的后面、也就是房子右边跑去。
“准备开枪，朋友们！”史密斯大声说。
移民们端起抢来，随时准备迎击敌人。
托普还在不停地叫。杰普向托普追去，也尖声叫嚷起来。
移民们跟着杰普，来到大树覆盖下的小溪边。在明亮的月光下，他们看见了什么呢？五具尸体躺在河岸上！
这就是四个月以前在林肯岛上登陆的那些罪犯！
Book 3 Chapter 13
How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for a moment before he was dreading their return.
But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.
The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton's house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separation.
Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as much as he knew.
The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November, at nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the palisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern, at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge.
His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were about to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by the name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to murdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!
But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his former accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the island, after murdering the colonists!
Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned, would rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton--bound, gagged, and closely watched--lived in this cave for four months.
Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after their arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on Ayrton's stores, but did not live at the corral.
On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the colonists' arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned alone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding's dagger.
Ayrton's anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of Herbert's death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert's illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it.
The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and night. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear possible that he could escape.
Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts, still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their retreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior of the island, or the south coast.
Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope of ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened by ill- treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and hearing failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two days, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred.
"But, Captain Harding," he added, "since I was imprisoned in that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?"
"How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?" answered the engineer.
"Dead!" cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his weakness.
His companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their assistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little stream.
It was now broad daylight.
There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken by death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five convicts!
Ayrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without uttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined the bodies, already stiffened by the cold.
They bore no apparent trace of any wound.
Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of one, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder of that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause of which it was impossible to conjecture.
"It is there that they have been struck!" said Cyrus Harding.
"But with what weapon?" cried the reporter.
"A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the secret!"
"And who has struck the blow?" asked Pencroft.
"The avenging power of the island," replied Harding, "he who brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will accomplished, conceals himself from us."
"Let us make search for him, then!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Yes, we will search for him," answered Harding, "but we shall not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases to call us to him!"
This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing, both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity evinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding's eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit.
"Let us search," he resumed, "and God grant that we may some day be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal with ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some signal service!"
From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree superhuman power.
In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground.
Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during his seclusion. He learned Herbert's adventures, and through what various trials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered him.
"And now," said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, "a duty remains for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that we are once more masters of the island."
"Well!" answered Gideon Spilett, "let us search all this labyrinth of the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!"
"And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our benefactor," said Herbert.
"Yes," said the engineer, "we will do all that it is humanly possible to do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us."
"Shall we stay at the corral?" asked Pencroft.
"We shall stay here," answered Harding. "Provisions are abundant, and we are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides, if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House."
"Good!" answered the sailor. "Only I have a remark to make."
"What is it?"
"Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have a voyage to make."
"A voyage?" said Gideon Spilett.
"Yes, to Tabor Island," answered Pencroft. "It is necessary to carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows if it is not already too late?"
"But, Pencroft," asked Ayrton, "how do you intend to make this voyage?"
"In the 'Bonadventure.'"
"The 'Bonadventure!'" exclaimed Ayrton. "She no longer exists."
"My 'Bonadventure' exists no longer!" shouted Pencroft, bounding from his seat.
"No," answered Ayrton. "The convicts discovered her in her little harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her--"
"And?" said Pencroft, his heart beating.
"And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the vessel went to pieces."
"Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!" exclaimed Pencroft.
"Pencroft," said Herbert, taking the sailor's hand, "we will build another 'Bonadventure'--a larger one. We have all the ironwork--all the rigging of the brig at our disposal."
"But do you know," returned Pencroft, "that it will take at least five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?"
"We can take our time," said the reporter, "and we must give up the voyage to Tabor Island for this year."
"Oh, my 'Bonadventure!' my poor 'Bonadventure!'" cried Pencroft, almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud.
The loss of the "Bonadventure" was certainly a thing to be lamented by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired as soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with bringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the island.
The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and lasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and their numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the proper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown. But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner.
The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and in which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This cavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve.
The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and other trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the picturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer. Stones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the rocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be seen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount Franklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became rivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the Serpentine Peninsula was watered.
Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary for life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had they discovered the presence of man.
Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of lava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?
The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of two valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation, strewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great blocks of mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration. It contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly concealed and difficult of access.
The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic period, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into the depths of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries, waving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they sounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did not appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient passages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of the island.
However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that absolute silence did not reign there.
On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear a deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the rocks.
Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant mutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires. Several times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process was taking place in the bowels of the earth.
"Then the volcano is not totally extinct?" said the reporter.
"It is possible that since our exploration of the crater," replied Cyrus Harding, "some change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered extinct, may evidently again burst forth."
"But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred," asked Spilett, "would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?"
"I do not think so," answered the reporter. "The crater, that is to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet."
"Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts of the island!"
"And why, my dear Spilett," answered Cyrus Harding, "should it not follow the road naturally traced out for it?"
"Well, volcanoes are capricious," returned the reporter.
"Notice," answered the engineer, "that the inclination of Mount Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain's center of gravity."
"But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times," observed Gideon Spilett.
"Always," replied the engineer, "especially when the subterranean forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At any rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would he seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground is considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring parts of Shark Gulf."
"We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate an approaching eruption," said Gideon Spilett.
"No," answered Harding, "not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it is probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have accumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which I spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the first serious effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas. Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an eruption."
"And yet we are not mistaken," remarked the reporter. "Mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!"
"You are right," said the engineer, again listening attentively. "There can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result."
Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to whom they made known the state of affairs.
"Very well!" cried Pencroft, "The volcano wants to play his pranks! Let him try, if he likes! He will find his master!"
"Who?" asked Neb.
"Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him, if he so much as pretends to open it!"
As may be seen, the sailor's confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it knew how to escape the colonists' most minute researches, for, in spite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,--the obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered.
From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret nooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every rock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at the bottom of which opened the crater.
They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths the rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or vapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption. But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search.
Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest, although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf. No one!--nothing!
Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly expended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions.
It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be prolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.
On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the door, they re-established communication between their habitation and the ground.
A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.
事情是怎么发生的？是谁杀死罪犯的呢？是艾尔通吗？不，刚才他还担心罪犯们会回来呢！
艾尔通从说完刚才那几句话以后，就失去了知觉。现在他已经完全陷入昏迷状态，一动也不动地躺在床上。
居民们胡思乱想，感到非常纳闷。由于过度的激动，他们在艾尔通的房间里整整等了一夜，再也没有到躺着罪犯们尸体的地方去。大概艾尔通也不能说明这些尸体怎样来的，因为他连自己在畜栏里都不知道。可是，他至少能够叙述一下这个恐怖场面发生以前的情况。第二天，艾尔通从昏迷状态中清醒过来了。分别了一百零四天，他几乎还是安然无恙，伙伴们和他重新见面的时候表现了亲切的喜悦。
艾尔通简短地叙述了事情发生的经过——至少是尽他所知道的一切。
去年11月10日，他来到畜栏的第二天晚上，罪犯们翻过栅栏，向他袭击。他们把他绑起来，堵住他的嘴，然后把他带到富兰克林山麓的一个幽暗的山洞里去，那就是罪犯们的巢穴。
他们已经决定要在第二天把他处死了，恰好这时候有一个罪犯认出了他，并且喊出过去他在澳洲所用的名字。假若是艾尔通，这些匪徒就毫不犹豫地把他杀害了！然而这是彭•觉斯，所以他们把他留下来！
于是，从那时候起，艾尔通就一再受到老部下的胁迫。他们打算要他重新入伙，依靠他的帮助，打进他们一直没能上去的“花岗石宫”，占据这所住宅，杀死全体移民，做岛上的主人！
艾尔通的意志是坚定不移的，这个昔日的罪犯，现在已经悔过自新，得到了宽恕；他宁肯牺牲自己，也不愿出卖他的伙伴。艾尔通被绑着身子，堵住嘴，在山洞里监禁了将近四个月。
虽然罪犯们在岛上登陆以后不久就发现了畜栏，并且从那时起，一直依靠艾尔通的物资维持生活，但是他们并没有住在里面。
11月11日，两个匪徒在畜栏里突然发现居民们来了，就向赫伯特开了一枪。其中的一个逃回去了。他向其他的罪犯夸耀，说打死了一个岛上的居民；但他却是一个人回来的。前面已经说过，他的伙伴被赛勒斯•史密斯刺死了。
当艾尔通听到赫伯特牺牲了的消息，他的不安和绝望是可以想象的。现在只剩下四个居民了，而他们似乎还受着罪犯的威胁。这件事情以后，在居民们因赫伯特养伤而耽搁在畜栏里的整个期间，海盗们一直没有离开山洞；甚至在他们劫掠过眺望岗的高地以后，他们为了谨慎起见，还是隐匿在山洞里。
这时候，他们对待艾尔通更加残酷了。由于成天被绑，他的手上和脚上到现在还留着血痕。他要想逃走似乎是不可能的，只有等待着死。
这种情况一直继续到二月份的第三个星期。罪犯们很少离开他们的老窝，仅仅有时到荒岛的内陆或南岸一带去打过几次猎，但是他们心里却无时不在等待机会。
艾尔通以后一直没有听到关于伙伴们的消息，他觉到已经没有任何希望再和他们见面了。最后，经不起种种的虐待，这个不幸的人陷入了虚脱状态，视觉和听觉都严重地减退了。从那时起，也就是说，两天以来，什么情况他都不知道。
“可是，史密斯先生，”他接着说，“既然我被监禁在那个山洞里，我怎么会到畜栏来的呢？”
“是啊，罪犯们又怎么会死在栅栏里边的呢？”工程师反问道。
“死了！”艾尔通不顾身体的虚弱，从床上半撑起身来叫道。
伙伴们扶着他。他想要爬起来，在伙伴们的扶持下，艾尔通下了床。于是他们一同向小溪边走去。
这时候天已经大亮了。
就在这里的河岸上，躺着五个罪犯的尸体，他们的样子看来象是被打死不久！
艾尔通楞住了。史密斯和他的伙伴们默默地望着他。纳布和潘克洛夫根据工程师的手势，去检验尸体。这时候，尸体已经冰冷僵硬了。
尸体上并没有显著的伤痕。
经过仔细的检验，潘克洛夫才发现第一具尸体的额头上，第二具的胸膛上，第三具的脊背上，第四具的肩膀上，各有一个小红点。这是一种很难辨认出来的创伤，究竟怎么来的，却还是猜不透。
“他们就是在这里被打中的！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“可是用的是什么武器呢？”通讯记者大声问道。
“一种有着闪电效果的武器，不过我们不知道它的秘密！”史密斯回答说。
“是谁打的呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“岛上的正义复仇者，”史密斯答道。“艾尔通，你就是被他带到畜栏里来的。他又一次发挥了他的威力。我们自己做不到的，他都替我们做了。他总是在达到目的以后，避开我们。”
“那么，我们去找他吧！”潘克洛夫叫道。
“是的，我们要找他，”史密斯说，“可是，在他愿意召见我们以前，我们是没有办法找到这个创造奇迹的伟大人物的！”
居民们在这种肉眼看不见的保佑下面，自己的行动显得一点用处也没有，赛勒斯•史密斯不禁感到又烦恼又着急。这种相形见绌的情况往往会伤害一个人的自尊心的。同时用拒绝别人感恩的方法来表示自己慷慨，这也包含着瞧不起受惠人的成分。因此，在赛勒斯•史密斯看来，反而在某种程度上降低了这一切义举的价值。
“我们去找吧！”他接着说，“但愿有一天我们能够向这位高傲的保卫者证明，我们不是忘恩负义的人！要是我们能够报答他，能够轮到我们为他尽一点点义务，表示表示我们的心意，即使要付出生命的代价，我又有什么理由不答应呢？”
从这天起，林肯岛上的居民就一心一意打算进行这次搜索了。每一件事都激励他们要去寻找这个谜的答案，这个答案只可能是一个确实赋有不可思议的能力——在某种程度上接近超凡——的人的名字。
几分钟以后，居民们回到屋子里来。在大家照料下，艾尔通的精神和体力很快就复原了。
纳布和潘克洛夫把罪犯的尸体运到离畜栏不远的森林里去，把他们埋葬起来。
然后，他们向艾尔通讲述了在他被监禁期间所发生的事情。他这才知道赫伯特遭到的危险和居民们经历的种种灾难。原来居民们已经认为没有希望再和艾尔通重新见面，以为罪犯们残酷地把他杀害了。
“现在，”赛勒斯•史密斯叙述完了以后，接着说，“我们还要办一件事。我们的任务才完成一半。虽然以后可以不再担心罪犯们的骚扰，但是我们这次重新成为岛上的主人却不是依靠自己的力量达到的。”
“好吧！”吉丁•史佩莱说，“我们就去搜索富兰克林山支脉一带整个错综复杂的山区吧。我们决不放过一个山沟和洞穴！啊！假如能够发现秘密，朋友们，我就是第一个迎接秘密的通讯记者了！”
“如果找不到恩人，我们决不回‘花岗石宫’。”赫伯特说。
“是的，”工程师说，“凡是人力能够达到的，我们都要去做。可是我还要重复一遍，恐怕只有他愿意见我们的时候，我们才能找到他。”
“我们就暂时住在畜栏里吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“是的，”史密斯回答说。“这里粮食很多，又正好是搜查范围的中心。再说，如果有必要回‘花岗石宫’，坐上大车很快就可以到了。”
“好！”水手说。“不过我有一个意见。”
“什么意见？”
“现在好天气一天天过去了，我们不要忘记，还要航海。”
“航海？”吉丁•史佩莱问道。
“是啊，到达抱岛去，”潘克洛夫回答说。“也许苏格兰游船就要来接艾尔通回去了。必须送一封信到达抱岛去，说明林肯岛的位置，还要说明艾尔通在这儿。也许现在已经太迟了，那有谁知道呢？”
“可是，潘克洛夫，”艾尔通问道，“你打算怎么航海呢？”
“用乘风破浪号。”
“乘风破浪号！”艾尔通大声说。“早已没有了。”
“我的乘风破浪号没有了？”潘克洛夫从坐位上跳起来叫道。
“不错，”艾尔通说。“八天以前，罪犯们才在小港湾里发现它的，他们乘着它航海，后来……”
“后来怎么样？”潘克洛夫紧接着追问一句，他的心直跳。
“因为没有鲍勃•哈维掌舵，他们一下子撞在石头上。把船撞碎了。”
“啊呀！这些强盗、土匪、不要脸的家伙！”潘克洛夫大骂起来。
“潘克洛夫，”赫伯特拉着他的手说，“我们可以再造一只乘风破浪号，造一只更大的。我们全部铁器都有，双桅船上的整套索具都可以拿来随便使用。”
“可是你知道吗，”潘克洛夫说，“一只三四十吨的船，至少要五六个月才能造成呢！”
“我们可以想法子利用时间，”通讯记者说，“今年只好不到达抱岛去了。”
“有什么办法呢，潘克洛夫！”工程师说。“只好克制自己，冷静一些。但愿晚一点到达抱岛去，对我们不会有什么害处。”
“唉，我的乘风破浪号！可怜的乘风破浪号！”潘克洛夫听说一向引以自豪的船遭到毁坏，他的心几乎碎了。
失去了乘风破浪号，对居民们说来，的确是一件值得惋惜的事情。他们一致同意尽速弥补这个损失。这个问题决定以后，他们就要开始在荒岛上最隐蔽的地方进行搜索了。
从2月19日破晓开始，他们出发探险，前后一共经历了一个星期。山麓的支脉和无数的分支形成了错综复杂的谷地和丘陵。这些峡谷的深处——甚至也许连富兰克林山的内部都要包括在内——显然正是他们应该搜索的地方。如果有人打算在岛上找一个别人发现不了的住处，那么到这里来是再适合也没有了。由于这些山谷的地形非常复杂，因此赛勒斯•史密斯只好严格地挨次进行搜查。
居民们首先察看了通向火山南部的山谷，瀑布河一开头就是从这个山谷里流过的。在这里，艾尔通把大家引导到罪犯们藏身的山洞里去。在没有被送回畜栏以前，他就是在这里监禁着的。山洞还是和艾尔通离开的时候一样。他们在里面找到不少火药和粮食，都是罪犯们从别处搬来贮藏在这里的。
山洞附近的山谷有枞树和其他树木覆盖着，他们全部都搜遍了。绕过西南支脉的拐角以后，移民们进入了一条峡谷，这里的景致很象那一带分布着奇形怪状的玄武石柱的海滨。峡谷里的树木比较稀疏，乱石代替了青草。野山羊和摩弗仑羊在岩石间纵跳着。从这一带开始，就是岛上荒芜的地区了。虽然富兰克林山麓向各处分散出的山谷很多，但是已经可以看出，峡谷和畜栏的山谷一样，遍布着树林和大量牧草的只有三条。畜栏的山谷西面靠近瀑布河河谷，东面靠红河河谷。这两股小溪由附近各个山涧会合而成。由于它们的滋润，使得山南一带的土地非常肥沃，溪水流到下游以后，和许多支流会合在一起，才成了河流。慈悲河则是由啄木鸟林中较大的泉水直接会合而成的，这种泉水伸展成无数溪流，使盘蛇半岛的土壤得到了水源。
这三条水量充沛的河谷，哪一条都可以被隐士选为藏身的地方，因为这里有一切的生活必需品。然而居民们搜查遍了，各处都没有发现人的踪影。
那么，这位隐士和他的住所，是不是在那些荒芜的峡谷深处、乱石丛中、崎岖的北部山峡或是熔岩流过的地方呢？
富兰克林山的北麓只有两条山谷，这两条山谷相当宽阔，却不太深，里面任何草木也看不见，只有铺在谷底的熔岩，零乱地散布着的许多岩石，包括各种火山岩石和大块的矿石。这一带需要较长的时间仔细搜查。这里有成千的洞窟，虽然不适宜居住，但是却非常隐蔽，很难过去。
居民们甚至连阴暗的地道也钻进去看看，一直进入深山。这些地道是从火山爆发时期就存在的。由于在这里喷射过火焰，洞里还保持着被熏黑的一片。他们摇曳着火把，穿过这些黑暗的走廊，连最小的洞隙都一一仔细察看了。他们也探测了那些很浅的地道，然而一切都是阴森森的，这些古老的地道看来一向没有人走过，也没有人移动过一块岩石——岩石都保持着荒岛在海底时火山把它们喷射出水面的样子。
虽然这些地道看起来十分荒凉，非常阴暗，赛勒斯•史密斯却应该承认这里并不是一点声音也没有。
他们走到一个深达几百英尺直通深山内部的阴暗洞底时，工程师忽然听见一种低沉的隆隆声，并且由于有岩石的回响，声音变得更大，这使他感到非常惊讶。
同他在一起的吉丁•史佩莱也听到了这种远处传来的隆隆声，这说明地下的火焰复燃了。他们倾听了很久，都认为地底下正在进行着化学变化。
“那么，火山还没有完全熄灭吗？”通讯记者问道。
“在我们上次探索火山口以后，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“也许又发生了什么变化。任何一座被认为已经熄灭的火山，肯定都会重新爆发的。”
“可是，如果富兰克林山爆发起来，”史佩莱问道，“会不会给林肯岛带来危险呢？”
“我想是不会的，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“因为火山口就好比安全活门。有了它，烟和岩浆就可以从这里喷出来。过去它们一向就是从这条出口出去的。”
“要是岩浆朝着岛上的富饶地区冲出一个新的出口来，情况就不同了！”
“亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“为什么你要认为它不走原来的道路呢？”
“嗯，火山是捉摸不定的。”通讯记者回答说。
“注意，”工程师说，“富兰克林山的斜度使山涧水往我们现在所探索的山谷这边流，要改变流水的方向，除非发生一次地震，改变山的重心才行。”
“可是目前恐怕随时都可能发生地震。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“随时，”工程师说，“不错，特别是在地下的力量停歇了很久时期，现在刚开始复活，是可能遇到一些障碍的。在这种情况下，亲爱的史佩莱，要是火山爆发起来，就会给我们带来严重的后果了。最好火山根本就没有复活的意思。不过我们是没法阻止它的，是不是？但是，即使真的爆发了，我想眺望岗也不会遭到多大威胁。因为眺望岗和富兰克林山之间的地面相当低，要是岩浆向格兰特湖流过来，它一定会落在中途的沙丘上和鲨鱼湾附近的。”
“我们还没有看见山顶上有表明火山快要爆发的烟呢。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“不错，”史密斯说，“我昨天刚仔细看过山顶，火山口连一丝烟雾也没有。可是经过的时间很长了，喷火口的下部也许会堆积一些石块、岩烬和凝结了的熔岩，这些东西随时都可能因为积累得过多，把我刚才所说的活门堵住。可是，经过第一次猛烈的爆炸以后，一切的障碍就都排除了。我们的荒岛好比锅炉，火山好比烟囱；我敢向你保证，亲爱的史佩莱，到时候它们都不会由于受到气体的压力而爆炸的。不过，我还是这样说，最好火山不要爆发。”
“但是我们并没有听错，”通讯记者说。“火山的内部明明在响呢！”
“你说得对，”工程师一面说，一面又仔细听了一会。“里面发生了骚动。这是没有疑问的。我们既不能估计它的力量，又没法推测它会造成什么后果。”
赛勒斯•史密斯和史佩莱从地道里出来以后，把这些情况告诉了伙伴们。
“好哇！”潘克洛夫叫道，“火山想作怪了！要是它高兴的话，让它来吧！会有人来制服它的！”
“谁！”纳布问道。
“我们那位好心肠的圣人，纳布，就是我们那位好心的圣人，要是火山胆敢开口，他会把它的嘴堵起来的！”
从这件事上可以看出，水手对于这位守护荒岛的神灵的信仰是十分虔诚的。这种神秘的力量，到现在为止，已经发挥过许多次了，而且每一次都有一种莫名其妙的表现方式。的确，他的力量好象是无边无际的。此外，他还懂得怎样逃避移民们最仔细的搜查；尽管他们费尽了心机，尽管他们远征的热情甚至已达到顽强的程度，这个神秘人物的住处还是没法找到。
从2月19日到2月25日，他们搜索了林肯岛的整个北部地区，连最隐蔽的角落也查遍了。居民们甚至一块挨一块地敲打岩石，一直搜查到山的边缘。他们就这样一直来到削平了的火山锥顶，也就是第一行岩石的终点；然后又来到上面“大帽子”的山脊上。“大帽子”的底下就是火山口。
他们所做的还不仅仅是这些。他们察看了深渊。这时候深渊已经没有火，在它的深处却清晰地传来了隆隆的响声。但是，并没有任何迹象可以说明火山将要爆发——既没有烟雾，石头也不烫。至于移民们所找的那个人，不管在这里，还是在富兰克林山的其余部分，都没有发现他的踪迹。
接着，他们就去搜索沙丘。尽管要想到鲨鱼湾的平地都十分困难，他们还是从上到下，仔细地察看了高耸在海湾里的熔岩峭壁。但是，没有人！什么也没有！
总之，这两句结论说明他们白费气力，徒劳无功，说明赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们失望得甚至有点恼怒了。
现在是应该考虑回家的时候了，因为这种搜索是不能无限期拖下去的。居民们认为这个神秘的人决不住在荒岛的表面上，这一点是肯定的；于是他们不禁想入非非。特别是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们认为这事情不只是神秘，因此他们往超脱凡人以外的境界去想。
2月25日，居民们回到“花岗石宫”里来了。他们利用弓箭，把双股的绳索射到门槛口，恢复了地面和住宅之间的交通。
又过了一个月，在3月25日那天，他们纪念了到林肯岛来的三周年。
Book 3 Chapter 14
Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from Richmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of their country, always present in their thoughts!
They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed. But what had been the incidents of this terrible war? How much blood had it not cost? How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle? They often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee the day when they would be permitted once more to see their country. To return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link with the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their native land and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of their existence in this colony, founded by them, and which would then be dependent on their country, was this a dream impossible to realize?
There were only two ways of accomplishing it--either a ship must appear off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel strong enough to sail to the nearest land.
"Unless," said Pencroft, "our good genius, himself provides us with the means of returning to our country."
And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not even have made a gesture of surprise. In their state of mind nothing appeared improbable.
But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to fact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel--a really urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as soon as possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton's new residence.
As the "Bonadventure" no longer existed, six months at least would be required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was approaching, and the voyage would not be made before the following spring.
"We have time to get everything ready for the fine season," remarked the engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. "I think, therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel it will be best to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch yacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain. It may even be that, having arrived several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly searched for some trace of Ayrton. Will it not then he best to build a ship which, if necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian Archipelago or to New Zealand? What do you think?"
"I think, captain," answered the sailor; "I think that you are as capable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor the tools are wanting. It is only a question of time."
"And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to 300 tons?" asked Harding.
"Seven or eight months at least," replied Pencroft. "But it must not be forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is difficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky."
"Well," replied Cyrus Harding, "that will be exactly the most favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island or to a more distant land."
"So it will, captain," answered the sailor. "Make out your plans then; the workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good helping hand."
The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer's plan, and it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the construction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great labor, but the colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by their previous success.
Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in felling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks. The forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms. They took advantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a practicable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were carried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to the road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the Serpentine Peninsula.
It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for they could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to allow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously during the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial gales of some violence. Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his stout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.
All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the Chimneys, and there awaited the time for use.
The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the northern zone. At the same time other work was actively continued, and soon all trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the poultry-yard. It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions, for the feathered population had increased considerably. The stable now contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed themselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony now possessed a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular Yorkshire or Kentucky oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their arms never tired. Then who could have enjoyed better health than these workers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as they formed a thousand plans for the future!
As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect, and there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral. Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions. But he was a valuable workman at need--strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He was esteemed and loved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.
In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of the settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look after the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of milk required by Neb. These excursions at the same time afforded opportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with Top in front, traversed more often than their companions the road to the corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras, agouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse, jacamars, and snipe for small game, were never wanting in the house. The produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed, several turtles which were taken, excellent salmon which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the plateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb, the head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away.
The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course been repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers was at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there. Besides, the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at any rate from men.
However, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of pirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was possible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the secret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate him. The colonists, therefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington Bays. when they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west with no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a large section of the western horizon.
Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to be on their guard.
The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had conceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which, if necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy. Granite House might, by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the corral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained, would always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land on the island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage. This was a project which might be left for consideration, and they were, besides, obliged to put off its execution until the next spring.
About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard, and soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities, rose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet in length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam. But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the frosts and bad weather. During the following week they fixed the first of the stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.
During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The wind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed--which besides, he could not have established in any other place near to Granite House--for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from the fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the very foot of the granite cliff.
But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted to the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely covered by Flotsam Point.
Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued their labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind tearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather. But when a severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring the hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the 10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.
Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was comparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at almost the same distance from the equator. In the northern hemisphere, or at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of the United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation of the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no intumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds; here, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.
"It has even been observed," remarked Harding one day to his companions, "that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by the cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the winters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of Scotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the heat which it received during the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a better situation for benefiting by this restitution."
"But then, Captain Harding," asked Herbert, "why does Lincoln Island appear to escape the common law?"
"That is difficult to explain," answered the engineer. "However, I should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the situation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know, my boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere."
"Yes," said Herbert, "and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in the south than in the north of the Pacific."
"That is true," remarked Pencroft, "and when I have been serving on board whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn."
"The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island," said Gideon Spilett, "may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs comparatively near to Lincoln Island."
"Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett," answered Cyrus Harding, "and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that we owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an entirely physical cause, which renders the Southern colder than the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer, it is necessarily more distant during the winter. This explains then the excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if we find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that the summers here, on the contrary, are very hot."
"But why, if you please, captain," asked Pencroft, knitting his brows, "why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn't just, that!"
"Friend Pencroft," answered the engineer, laughing, "whether just or not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this peculiarity. The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but an ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its course is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest from the sun, and at another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to the sun. Now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold. Nothing can be done to prevent that, and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be, can never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God Himself."
"And yet," added Pencroft, "the world is very learned. what a big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!"
"And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!" answered Harding.
At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold with its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to Granite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more particularly to Gideon Spilett.
"Look here," said he to Neb one day, "I would give you by notarial deed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good enough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper for me! Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is the knowing every morning what has happened the day before in other places than this!"
Neb began to laugh.
"'Pon my word," he replied, "the only thing I think about is my daily work!"
The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.
The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity, achieved by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the brig had been a new source of riches. Without speaking of the complete rig which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and tools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments, were now piled in the storerooms of Granite House. It had not even been necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials. Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their first winter, the bad season might now come without their having any reason to dread its severity. Linen was plentiful also, and besides, they kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium, which is nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and chlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda, and the chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for various domestic purposes, and especially in bleaching linen. Besides, they did not wash more than four times a year, as was done by families in the olden times, and it may be added, that Pencroft and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper, distinguished themselves as washermen.
So passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe, and the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter. But then, what splendid fires blazed continually on the hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with long, zebra-like streaks! Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a few steps from them. Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the construction of the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which required more trouble to transport.
Men and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must be confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary to make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a servant he was, clever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and he might have been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped brothers in the Old and New Worlds!
"As for that," said Pencroft, "when one has four hands at one's service, of course one's work ought to be done so much the better!"
And indeed the intelligent creature did it well.
During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made round the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought back fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His power was not manifested in any way. It is true that it would have been superfluous, for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any painful trial.
Cyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between the unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established through the granite, and if Top's instinct had as it were felt it, there was no further sign of it during this period. The dog's growling had entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two friends-- for they were such--no longer prowled round the opening of the inner well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who could tell what the future might have in reserve?
At last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which might be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.
On the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw smoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising in the air.
里士满的俘虏们已经逃出来三年了。在这三年里，他们谈论过多少次自己所念念不忘的祖国啊：
他们深信内战已经结束了，他们认为北军的正义事业是不可能不获得胜利的。但是，在这场可怕的战争里，发生了哪些事情呢？究竟有多少人为它洒了鲜血呢？他们有多少朋友在这场战争里牺牲了性命呢？这些问题是他们常常谈起的，但是目前他们还不知道什么时候才能重新回到祖国。要是能回去一趟，哪怕仅仅是几天，只要和文明世界恢复社会联系，在故乡和林肯岛之间建立交通，然后再回到岛上来，也就满足了。那时候他们找到的这决土地已经属于他们的祖国，他们不妨在这里度过他们一生中最长的、也许是最幸福的一段日子。这个理想难道不能实现吗？
要实现这个理想，只有两种可能：或是有船到林肯岛附近来，或是移民们自己造一只船航行到最近的陆地去。
“只有等我们这位好心的圣人供给我们回国的工具了。”潘克洛夫说。
的确，即使有人告诉潘克洛夫和纳布，有一只三百吨重的大船在鲨鱼湾或气球港等着他们，他们也丝毫不会感到奇怪的。目前在他们的脑子里，不管什么事似乎没有不可能发生的了。
可是赛勒斯•史密斯却不那么有信心，他劝他们面对现实，特别是在造船这个问题上，更应该现实一些，因为这的确是一件紧急任务——必须尽快乘船把写明艾尔通的新地址的信件送到达抱岛去。
乘风破浪号已经没有了，造一只新船至少要六个月。不过现在冬天快来了，在开春以前，是不能航海的。
“我们有足够的时间在天气转暖以前做好一切准备，”工程师在和潘克洛夫商量这些问题的时候说。“朋友，既然我们要重新造船，我想最好还是把它造得大一些。要等苏格兰游船到达抱岛去，那是很靠不住的。它可能在几个月以前去过达抱岛，因为没有找到艾尔通的踪迹，已经离开了。如果造一只大船，在必要的时候，我们能乘着它到玻里尼西亚群岛或新西兰去，那不好吗？你认为怎么样？”
“史密斯先生，”水手回答说，“我认为大船和小船你都能够造。木料和工具都不缺少，只是时间问题。”
“造一只二百五十吨到三百吨的船，要几个月？”史密斯问道。
“至少七八个月，”潘克洛夫答道。“而且冬天快要到了，要知道在严寒封冻的时候，是很难做木工活的。我们必须估计到要耽搁几个星期的工作。要是能在明年十一月把船造好，就很不错了。”
“好，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“那正是航海的好时候，到达抱岛去也好，到更远的地方去也好，不管是哪一种性质的航海，哪个季节都合适。”
“那么，就这样吧，史密斯先生，”水手说。“你去设计图样，工人随时都有。我想艾尔通是可以做一个得力的帮手的。”
和居民们商量了以后，大家一致同意工程师的计划。的确，这要算是最好的办法了。造一只二三百吨的大船，固然需要花很大的劳力，但是移民们觉得以前曾经成功过，因此很有信心。
于是赛勒斯•史密斯忙着设计船的图样和做模型了。在这期间，伙伴们就去砍伐树木，把木料运来做肋材、船骨和铺板。远西森林里有很好的橡树和榆树。他们把上次远征时所打开的通道辟成一条可以通行的道路，把它叫做远西路，砍下来的树木都运到“石窟”去，造船所就设在那里。上面说的那条路，由于选择树木的缘故，开辟得弯弯曲曲的，可是这样一来，往盘蛇半岛的大片地区去倒方便了。
有一点值得注意的是：伐树和锯木料的工作必须加快了，因为湿木料是不能用的，必须经过一段时间木料才能干燥。因此，木工们在四月份工作得非常紧张，只是在秋分时节刮暴风，工作才受到一些影响。小杰普非常灵巧，对他们有很大帮助，它有时上树系绳子，有时用结实的肩膀扛砍下来的树干。
“石窟”附近盖了一间大棚子，把所有这些木料都堆在那里，等候开工。
四月份天气相当晴朗，和北半球十月的天气差不多。在这期间，其他工作也没有停顿，都在积极地进行着。不久以后，眺望岗高地上被摧残的遗迹就消失得干干净净了。磨坊已经重新建立起来，家禽场里也树起了新的建筑物。因为鸟类大大地增加，这些建筑物非加以扩大不可了。厩房里现在有五头野驴，除了一头小驴以外，其余的四头都训练得很好，既肯拉车子，又肯让人骑。小队现在有一张犁，他们常常用两头野驴拉犁，象约克州和肯特基的真正的耕牛一样。移民们分工合作，从来也没有感到劳累。正因为这样，这些工人们在锻炼中形成的健康还有谁能比得上呢？每当傍晚，他们为了建设远景而提出上千条计划的时候，“花岗石宫”里是多么愉快和欢乐啊！
当然，如今艾尔通和大家在一起工作，再也不提回畜栏去住的话了。但是他还是愁眉不展，很少说话，经常和伙伴一起参加工作，却很少跟大家一起谈笑。但在紧张的时候，他却是一个难能可贵的工人——强壮、敏捷、灵巧、聪明。人人都器重他、爱护他，这一点他是不会感觉不到的。
在这期间，他们并没有放下畜栏不管。每隔一天，总有一个居民驾着车或骑着驴去照料摩弗仑羊和山羊，并且把纳布所要的羊奶带回来。一路上有机会还可以打猎。因此，到畜栏去得最勤的是赫伯特和吉丁•史佩莱。他们带着上好的猎枪，由托普带路打猎；“花岗石宫”里从来也没有断过野味，大的有水豚、刺鼠、袋鼠和野猪；小的有野鸭、山鸡、松鸡、啄木鸟和鹬。此外还有兔场和蛤蜊场的产品、捉来的海龟、游到慈悲河来的美味的鲑鱼、高地上的蔬菜和森林里的野果，真是花色繁多，大厨师纳布一个人几乎都保管不过来了。
当然，畜栏和“花岗石宫”之间的电报线又恢复了。如果某一个居民到了畜栏，觉得需要在那里过夜，他们就打电报联系一下。现在，荒岛上又安全了，居民们不必担心遭到任何攻击——至少是人的攻击。
可是，已经发生过的事情，还是有可能重新发生的。随时都可能有海盗甚至逃犯向岛上进行袭击。鲍勃•哈维的秘密计划也许还有别的伙伴和党羽知道，他们可能会学习他，来作同样的尝试。因此，移民们细心地注意着荒岛周围的海面，每天都用望远镜扫视联合湾和华盛顿湾之间的水平线。当他们到畜栏去的时候，同样小心地注意西边的海面；在支脉上，他们可以看到很大一部分西方的水平线。
他们并没有发现什么可疑的东西，但是小心戒备还是必要的。
一天晚上，工程师向伙伴们宣布了一个为畜栏设防的计划。为了谨慎起见，他认为应该加高栅栏，并且在侧面建立一个木堡；在必要的时候，居民们可以利用它防御敌人。“花岗石宫”由于所处的地势好，可以说是攻不破的；因此，不管是什么海盗，只要一旦登陆，就会把畜栏以及它的建筑物、贮藏物资和牲畜作为目标了。如果移民们被迫守在里面，他们也应该能够保卫自己，而不受任何不利的威胁。这个计划是值得考虑的，但是他们要等到明年春天才能实行。
5月15日前后，新船的龙骨已经搁在造船所了；不久，船首材和船尾材也已用榫头分别接在龙骨的两头，几乎直立起来。龙骨是用优良的橡木做成的，长达一百一十英尺，上面可以横架一根宽二十五英尺的中央船辐。但是，木匠们做完这些工作以后，严寒和坏天气就来临了。在以后的几个星期里，他们安上了第一批船尾的肋材，然后就只好暂时停止工作。
在这个月的最后几天，天气变得非常环。东风有时和暴风一样猛烈。工程师有些为造船所的棚屋操心，然而，他却没法把它盖在其他靠近“花岗石宫”的地方，因为小岛只能挡住从大海冲向海岸的一部分怒潮，在暴风雨猛烈的时候，波涛甚至会一直冲到花岗石壁的脚底下。
幸而这些顾虑并没有成为事实。风向转往东南，“花岗石宫”的整个海滩都有遗物角给挡住了风。
潘克洛夫和艾尔通是造船工作中最热心的工人，他们尽可能地坚持劳动。他们是不怕风吹雨打的好汉，不论是好天还是坏天，总是抡起锤子就干。但是下过这场雨紧接着就是一阵严寒，木质纤维变得和铁一样坚硬，工作起来十分困难。6月10日前后，造船工程只好全部停顿了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们都有这么一个感觉，林肯岛冬季的气候是相当寒冷的，寒冷的程度和新英格兰各州（这几州和赤道之间的距离几乎和林肯岛和赤道之间的距离完全一样）差不多。在北半球，至少是在美洲的英国属地和美国北部，是由于北极附近地势平坦，没有高的山地阻挡北风，所以才寒冷的。但是在林肯岛，就不能这样解释了。
“人们已经注意到，”有一天史密斯对伙伴们说，“在纬度相同的地方，岛屿和沿海地区是不象内陆那么冷的。比方说，我常听说伦巴第的冬天并不比苏格兰的冬天暖和，这是因为苏格兰附近的海洋一到冬天就把它在夏天所吸收的热发散出来的缘故。由于岛屿能够受到这种影响，因此它的情况要比大陆好得多。”
“那么，史密斯先生，”赫伯特问道，“林肯岛为什么不符合一般规律呢？”
“这很难理解，”工程师回答说。“不过，我猜想这是由于林肯岛的位置在南半球的缘故。南半球比北半球冷，这一点，孩子，你是知道的。”
“是的，”赫伯特说，“拿冰山来说，南太平洋纬度较低的地方就比北太平洋纬度较低的地方要多。”
“不错，”潘克洛夫说，“我在捕鲸船上当水手的时候，就曾经在合恩角附近看见过冰山。”
“那么，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“林肯岛所以这么冷，也许是因为不远的地方有浮冰或是冰山的缘故。”
“你的看法的确很有道理，亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“显然我们受到的严寒是由于靠近冰山，我还要请你们注意一个完全属于自然的道理。它也可以说明为什么南半球比北半球冷。事实上，太阳和南半球的距离夏天比较近，因此在冬天也就必然要远一些。这就是寒暑两季温度悬殊的原因。如果我们觉得林肯岛的冬天特别冷，反过来我们也不要忘记，这里的夏天也特别热。”
“可是，对不起，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫皱着眉说，“为什么把我们的南半球划分得象你说的那么坏的呢？这，这不公平！”
“潘克洛夫同志，”工程师笑着说，“不管公平不公平，我们也只能顺着它。所以会划分得这样特别，道理是这样的：按着合理的力学定律，地球环绕太阳的轨道，不可能是圆形的，而只能是椭圆形。在地球运转的过程中，通过椭圆形中离太阳较远的一个极点的时候，它就是在远日点上；在另外一个时候，当它离太阳较近的时候，就是在近日点上。现在，在南半球的冬季，正是我们离太阳最远的时候，因此，这一带地区也就最冷。这是没有任何方法可以阻止的。潘克洛夫，不管人类的学识多么丰富，也绝对不能改变宇宙的规律。”
“但是，”潘克洛夫坚持往下说，“人类的知识是很丰富的。史密斯先生，要是把人所知道的一切写成一本书，这本书该有多大啊！”
“但是，假如把不知道的一切也写成一本书，那本书还要大得多呢！”史密斯说。
不管是什么原因，六月份照例带来了严寒，居民们只好成天坐守在“花岗石宫”里。啊！他们——特别是吉丁•史佩莱——对这种监禁生活感到多么腻烦啊！
“喂，”通讯记者有一天对纳布说，“不管你到哪儿去，假如你能大发慈悲给我订一份报来，我一定把我将来能够得到的全部财产都给你，说了就算！真的，对我说来最大的享受就是每天早上能知道前一天各地发生的事情了！”
纳布笑了起来。
“老实说，”他说，“我所想的只有我的日常工作！”
事实上，室内和室外一样，都有许多工作可做。
经过三年来不断的艰苦劳动，林肯岛小队的繁荣现在达到了全盛时代。双桅船的毁坏是一个新的富源。除了整套的索具可以装备正在建造中的新船以外，还有各种各样的器皿和工具、枪枝和弹药、衣服和用具，都储藏在“花岗石宫”的仓库里。甚至也不需要制造那种粗糙的“林肯毡”了。居民们在过第一个冬天的时候曾经挨过冻，但是现在不管天气多么坏，他们都没有害怕的必要了。他们有许多亚麻布制品，但还是用得很省。赛勒斯•史密斯利用氯化钠——其实就是海盐——毫不困难地取得小苏打和氯。小苏打很容易变成碳酸钠，再把氯做成氯化钙，工程师就这样把它们用在各种家庭用途上，特别是用它们把亚麻布漂白了。此外，他们和古老的家庭一样，一年至多不过洗四次衣服。应该附带说明，吉丁•史佩莱在等待邮差给他送报的同时，还和潘克洛夫充当了优秀的洗衣工人。
冬季的六月、七月、八月就这样过去了。这个月天气酷寒，平均温度只有华氏8度，比去年冬天还要低。但是，看那“花岗石宫”里的炉火多么旺盛啊！花岗石壁被烟熏成一条条的，和斑马身上的花纹一样。在离他们不远的地方就出产木柴，因此他们可以大量增添。只有煤炭运输起来比较困难些；但是在造船的时候，剩下许多零碎木头，可以使他们节省一些煤。
岛上的人畜都很平安。必须承认，小杰普有些怕冷。这恐怕是它唯一的弱点。居民们只好给它做一件厚厚的睡衣穿。它是一个多么好的仆人啊！——聪明、热心、慎重、不知道疲倦，也不爱多说话；它是完全有资格当选为新旧大陆猿猴类里的模范！
“它啊！”潘克洛夫说，“既然它有四只手干活，当然它的工作应该做得更好！”
事实上，这个机灵的畜生的确做得不错。
自从上次在山的周围进行了搜查以来，已经有七个月了。在这期间，包括天气转暖的九月份在内，荒岛上的圣人没有任何音信。他没有采用任何方法显示他的力量。事实上，即使发挥了力量，也是显不出来，因为移民们并没有遇到令人头痛的困难。
赛勒斯•史密斯甚至注意到，虽然陌生人有时候曾经通过“花岗石宫”和居民们取得联系，并且托普的直觉也曾经感觉出这一点，但是在这期间，却没有任何迹象说明这个事实。托普不咆哮了，猩猩也不再感到不安了。这两个朋友——它们的确是朋友——既不到地下井的井沿上去守望，也不再象工程师第一次看到的那样莫名其妙地叫喊了。但是，他能认为谜就是这些，永远也没法得到答案了吗？他能肯定以后不会再遇到什么紧急场合，使这个神秘的人当场出现吗？谁知道将来的事情会怎么样呢？
寒冬毕竟过去了。然而，就在大地回春的最初几天，发生了一件事。这件事可能会引起严重后果的。
9月7日，赛勒斯•史密斯观察了火山口，只见山顶上烟雾缭绕，第一缕蒸汽升向天空了。
Book 3 Chapter 15
The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.
The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer heaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be foreseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption, it was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from it. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island had already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava hardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape of the crater--the opening broken in the upper edge--the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.
However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at the summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open. This had occurred in the two hemispheres--at Etna, Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared. In fact, an earthquake--a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic eruption--is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain, and to open new outlets for the burning lava.
Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons. After all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater open in the southern side of Mount Franklin.
From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain, and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central crater.
However, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall on the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill, which rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The mechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of wood, a second vertical movement to move the saw--this was all that was wanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders, and pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September the skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay in the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the timbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the vessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very slender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a considerable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig had been saved after the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity of copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the carpenters had much to do.
Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking, and the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night came the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any time they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve o'clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then ascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.
Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting subject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then spoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage in the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation. But always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this colony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which a communication with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to end their days there.
"Herbert," said the sailor, "you will never abandon Lincoln Island?"
"Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay there."
"That was made up long ago, my boy," answered Pencroft. "I shall expect you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly chaps of your youngsters!"
"That's agreed," replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time.
"And you, Captain Harding," resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, "you will be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it support? Ten thousand at least!"
They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the reporter actually started a newspaper--the New Lincoln Herald!
So is man's heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and this it is which justifies it, over all the world.
After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little dream of the future.
Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan again and show himself to all restored.
One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged later than usual. It was nine o'clock. Already, long badly concealed yawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding towards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room, suddenly rang.
All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton, Pencroft, Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.
Cyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely believing their ears.
"What does that mean?" cried Neb. "Was it the devil who rang it?"
No one answered.
"The weather is stormy," observed Herbert. "Might not its influence of electricity--"
Herbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes were turned, shook his head negatively.
"We must wait," said Gideon Spilett. "If it is a signal, whoever it may be who has made it, he will renew it."
"But who do you think it is?" cried Neb.
"Who?" answered Pencroft, "but he--"
The sailor's sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.
Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:--
"What do you want?"
A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this reply to the tenants of Granite House:--
"Come to the corral immediately."
"At last!" exclaimed Harding.
Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists' fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without having uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They could do without them.
The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as the sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.
It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the island itself. The night was very threatening.
But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from finding the familiar road to the corral.
They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.
They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was no doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply concerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful in his action! Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of time?
Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds, influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.
During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by this remark from Pencroft:--
"We ought to have brought a torch."
And by this reply from the engineer:--
"We shall find one at the corral."
Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.
At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth.
The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.
The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible force.
At ten o'clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.
In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.
Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from thence that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through the window.
The engineer knocked at the door.
No answer.
Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which was perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.
There was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been left.
"Have we been deceived by an illusion?" murmured Cyrus Harding.
No! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,--
"Come to the corral immediately."
They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire. Everything was in order--the pile on the box containing it, as well as all the apparatus.
"Who came here the last time?" asked the engineer.
"I did, captain," answered Ayrton.
"And that was--"
"Four days ago."
"Ah! a note!" cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.
On this paper were written these words in English:--
"Follow the new wire."
"Forward!" cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating directly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to the old one.
Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm then burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each lightning- flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit of the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional flashes.
There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the isolator to the ground.
"There it is!" said he.
This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission of the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern spurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.
"Follow it!" said Cyrus Harding.
And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.
The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get forward as fast as possible.
Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its narrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The engineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and that the stranger's retreat would be there.
Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur, and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild basalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and felt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the wire was running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.
The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the colonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west. The wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.
Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.
At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side of a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning a fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea. The descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the danger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws iron.
Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in broad daylight would have been considered impracticable.
The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the gleams of light. Harding was first--Ayrton last. On they went, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on.
At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff.
There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the sea.
The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves.
His companions were stupefied.
A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must they then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine cavern? In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.
The engineer stopped them.
He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there--
"We must wait," said he. "The tide is high. At low water the way will be open."
"But what can make you think-" asked Pencroft.
"He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us to reach him!"
Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.
There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching in a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was re- echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.
The colonists' emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman apparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of the mysterious genius of the island.
At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to reconnoiter.
The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle, entered the yawning gulf.
Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,--
"In an hour the opening will be practicable."
"It is there, then?" said Pencroft.
"Did you doubt it?" returned Harding.
"But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height," observed Herbert.
"Either the cavern will be completely dry," replied Harding, "and in that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some means of transport will be put at our disposal."
An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was like the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.
Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the water. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior projection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the bottom.
"Jump in!" said Harding.
In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern, lighted the way.
The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly rose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too slight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to be ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a sound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides.
Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts dating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the sea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal's Cave, in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth caverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in length! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns, and preserved them for the admiration of man.
Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in short sentences, when all at once,--
"More to the right!" he commanded.
The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.
The wire was there fastened to the rock.
"Forward!" said Harding.
And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.
On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half-a- mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding's voice was again heard.
"Stop!" said he.
The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.
At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with light.
By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the projections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave, and it filled it entirely.
At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water, causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards the light, which was now not more than half a cable's length distant.
At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350 feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic wall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here considerably, the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if the light issued from them.
In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat. This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water.
The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He gazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the reporter's arm,--
"It is he! It can only be he!" he cried, "he!--"
Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett alone could hear.
The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,--
"He! an outlawed man!"
"He!" said Harding.
At the engineer's command the boat approached this singular floating apparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of light through a thick glass.
Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was there. All darted down the opening.
At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the end of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.
A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.
At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the engineer.
An immense saloon--a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry-- appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment.
Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice their presence.
Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his companions, he uttered these words,--
"Captain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.--"
居民们听了工程师的紧急通知，放下工作，默默地注视着富兰克林山的顶峰。
火山复活了。蒸汽透过火山口底下积累的矿石岩层升了起来。但是，地下火会不会引起猛烈的爆炸呢？这是很难预料的。不过，就算火山可能爆发，也不见得整个的林肯岛都会遭殃。火山里流出来的岩浆并不一定会造成灾祸，朝北的山坡上有一条条凝结的熔岩，从这里可以看出，荒岛已经遭受过这种考验了。并且，根据火山口的形状——它的缺口是开在上面的边缘部分的——还可以断定，岩浆多半要喷在富饶地区对面的那部分荒岛上。
但是，过去的情况却不一定能够回答将来的问题。在火山的顶峰，往往是把原有的火山口堵塞了，又钻出一个新的火山口来。这种情形在南半球和北半球都曾经有过，例如埃得纳火山、波波卡提佩特峰和奥里萨巴火山就是这样的。在爆炸的前夕，任何情形都可能发生。事实上，常常随着火山爆发而发生地震，这就能够改变火山的内部结构，给岩浆打开一条新的出路。
赛勒斯•史密斯向伙伴们解释了这些事情。他毫不夸大地向大家说明了正反两种可能性。总之，他们是没法阻止的。同时也应该说明，除非发生地震，动摇了地面，要不然“花岗石宫”大概是不会遭到危险的。但是，如果从富兰克林山的南边开出一个新的火山口来，畜栏就要遭到严重的威胁了。
从这一天起，山顶的烟就一直没有消失；而且可以看出，虽然其中没有夹带火焰，喷出来的烟却愈来愈高、愈来愈浓了。尤其是中央火山口较低的地方，喷出来的烟更浓。
不管怎么样，随着季节的转暖，工作又继续干起来了。造船的工作在尽快地进行。赛勒斯•史密斯利用岸上的瀑布，建立了一个水力锯木场；这么一来，树干很快就锯成铺板和托架了。这套机械装置和挪威乡村锯木场里所用的同样简单。先用一个水平的机械装置转动木块，再用另一个垂直机械装置转动钢锯，这就是全部的必要器材了。工程师用一个车轮，两个滚筒，和几个滑车，把它顺利地装配起来。九月底，在造船所里未来的纵帆船的骨架已经形成了。肋材也已经差不多完工，全部船骨暂时由箍条缚着，船的轮廓大致可以看得出来了。这只纵帆船船头很尖，后半部又细又长，一定是非常适合远航的。但是铺板工程还需要一段相当长的时间才能完成。幸而在海盗的双桅船爆炸以后，他们把船上的铁制品都保留下来了。潘克洛夫和艾尔通从铺板和损坏了的肋材上拔下一些螺丝钉和许多铜钉来，这就可以少做多少铁活；但是木工活却做也做不完。
为了在高地上进行收割、堆积干草和收获各种农作物，造船的工程停止了一个星期。农忙完毕，全部时间又都投入了安装纵帆船的工作。一到晚上，工人们真是筋疲力尽。为了不浪费一分一秒的时间，他们改变了吃饭的钟点；十二点钟吃午饭，直到天黑以后才吃晚饭。吃完以后就上“花岗石宫”去，立刻睡觉。
有时候他们谈起一些有趣的问题，也会延迟睡觉的时间。在这种情况下居民们谈到将来。要是乘纵帆船到有人居住的陆地去，是可能改变他们的环境的；于是他们愉快地谈起那时候将有哪些变化。但是，在谈论这些计划的时候，总有一种思想占着上风，那就是：以后他们还要回到林肯岛来。这块领地是他们用无数的劳力胜利地开拓出来的，一旦和美国取得联系，就可以得到新的动力，因此，他们决不放弃它。尤其是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们希望在林肯岛上过一辈子。
“赫伯特，”水手说，“你永远也不会离开林肯岛的，是不是？”
“是的，潘克洛夫，特别是假如你打定主意要留在这里，我更不会离开它了。”
“我早就打定主意了，孩子，”潘克洛夫说。“我在这里等你。你把你的妻子和小孩带到这儿来，我要把你的孩子教育成活泼天真的小家伙！”
“就这样吧。”赫伯特红着脸笑道。
“还有你，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫满腔热诚地接着说，“你永远是岛上的领袖！啊！岛上能够养活多少人呢？至少一万人！”
他们就这样谈笑，让潘克洛夫滔滔不绝地往下说。最后，根据他们的理想，通讯记者真的办了一种报纸——《林肯岛先驱新报》！
人的心情就是这样的。人类所以能成为万物之灵，就是因为有一种愿望：从事一种永垂不朽的事业，这种事业在他本人死了以后，还能够万古长存。正是由于这种信念，人类才树立了自己的权威，才毫无愧色地成为世界的主人！
除了这些以外，谁知道杰普和托普对它们的未来是不是怀着理想呢？
艾尔通暗暗地对自己说，希望能够重新看见格里那凡爵士，让他知道，自己已经改过自新了。
10月15日晚上，谈话时间拖得比平时要长一些。已经九点钟了。尽管大家都不想去睡觉，但还是忍不住打出长长的呵欠来，说明现在是休息的时候了。潘克洛夫正向床边走去，餐厅里的电报铃突然响了起来。
赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、艾尔通、潘克洛夫、纳布，人人都在场。居民们谁也没有到畜栏去。
赛勒斯•史密斯站起来了。伙伴们你看着我，我看着你，几乎不相信自己的耳朵。
“这是怎么回事？”纳布叫道。“是魔鬼在打铃吗？”
没有人回答。
“在这暴风雨的天气，”赫伯特说。“会不会是电流的感应……”
赫伯特的话没有说完。大家都注视着工程师，只见他否定地摇摇头。
“等一会儿，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“如果是信号，不管是谁，他一定会接着再发的。”
“可是你认为那是谁呢？”纳布大声问道。
“谁？”潘克洛夫回答说，“除了他……”
又是一声铃响，把水手的话打断了。
史密斯走到电报机旁边，向畜栏发出一个问题：
“你要什么？”
不一会儿，指针在字码表上给“花岗石宫”的居民们作了一个回答：
“立刻到畜栏来。”
“总算有答案了！”史密斯大声说。
是的！总算有答案了！现在秘密快要揭穿了。在一种强烈的兴趣鼓舞下，居民们的疲劳已经忘得干干净净。这种兴趣催促着他们到畜栏去，把他们休息的念头完全打消了。他们一句话也没有说，很快就离开了“花岗石宫”，来到海滩上。只有杰普和托普留在家里，他们这次不需要它们陪着去了。
夜色非常昏暗。新月已经和太阳一起西沉。正如赫伯特刚才所说的，黑压压的阴云象穹窿似的低罩在头上，遮盖得不透一点星光。远处暴风雨中划着几道闪电，照亮了水平线。
也许在几个钟头以后，岛上就要到处都是一片雷声了。这一晚天气非常险恶。
但是，不管天色多么昏暗，他们还是能找到熟悉的畜栏路的。
他们爬上慈悲河的左岸，来到高地，过了甘油河上的吊桥，走上穿过森林的大道。
他们的步伐很快，人人都不能抑制自己的兴奋心情。毫无疑问，现在他们很快就要知道这个猜了很久的哑谜的答案了！这个答案也就是那个神秘的人的名字；他和居民们的生活有着多么大的关系，为他们效劳的时候是多么慷慨，他是多么神通广大啊！要是这个陌生人没有和他们共处在一起，不知道他们的日常琐事，没有听到过“花岗石宫”里的每一句谈话，他怎么能总是在紧要关头来帮助他们呢？
人人都怀着心事，快步往前走去，在树枝搭成的拱门底下，一片漆黑，看不见哪里是路边。森林里鸦雀无声。在这种气压较低的情况下，飞禽走兽都静悄悄的，一动也不动。连一丝吹动树叶的微风也没有。只听见居民们的脚步在封冻的地面上发出回响。
走了一刻钟，潘克洛夫打破了周围的寂静：
“我们应该带一个火把。”
工程师回答他说：
“我们可以在畜栏里找到火把的。”
史密斯和他的伙伴们离开“花岗石宫”的时候是九点十二分。慈悲河距畜栏五英里，九点四十七分的时候，他们走了三英里。
这时候，闪电照亮了黑暗的森林，也照亮了整个的海岛。电光闪烁，使得他们几乎睁不开眼睛。显然，暴风雨就要来临。
闪电愈来愈亮，而且愈来愈频繁。远处的雷声在空中隆隆地响着。空气非常沉闷。
居民们好象有一种不可抗拒的力量推动着，急忙忙地赶路。
十点钟的时候，一道耀眼的闪电照亮了畜栏的栅栏。当他们走到门口的时候，霹雳般的雷声就响起来了。
不一会儿，史密斯就带领着大家，穿过畜栏，来到房屋的门前。
电报是从畜栏里发出的，因此陌生人大概就在屋子里。但是，窗户上却没有透出灯光来。
工程师敲了一下门。
没有回答。
赛勒斯•史密斯把门打开，居民们走进了屋子。屋里一片漆黑。纳布划了一根火柴，不一会就点着了灯，灯光照亮了房里的每个角落。
屋子里一个人也没有。一切都和他们上次离开这里的时候一样。
“我们是被错觉迷惑了吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯喃喃地说。
不！这是不可能的！电报清清楚楚地指出：
“立刻到畜栏来。”
他们走到专放电报机的桌子旁边。一切都照常，电池还是好好的装在匣子里，电报机也保持着原来的样子。
“谁最后到这儿来的？”工程师问道。
“是我，史密斯先生。”艾尔通回答说。
“那是在……”
“四天以前。”
“啊！一张通知！”赫伯特指着桌上的一张纸条，大声叫道。
纸上用英文写着：
沿着新电线一直走。
“走吧！”史密斯大声说。他已经明白了，电报不是从畜栏里发出，而是通过一根附加在旧线上的电线，从神秘的住处直接打给“花岗石宫”的。
纳布拿起点着的灯，大家离开了畜栏。这时候暴风雨的来势凶猛。闪电过后，紧接着就是雷声。在闪光中，不时可以看见烟雾缭绕的火山顶。
在畜栏的房屋和栅栏之间到处都找不到电报线。工程师跑到第一根电线杆旁边，在电光的照耀下，只见绝缘物上有一根新线一直拖到地面上。
“有了！”他说。
这根电线拖在地上，象海底电缆似的，外面包着一层绝缘物体，保护电流在里面自由通过。它好象穿过森林和富兰克林山的南部支脉，一直往西拉去。
“跟着它走！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
居民们立刻沿着电线，急急忙忙地向前走去。
雷声不断地轰鸣，连说话也听不见。不过，现在大家都在尽快地赶路，也顾不得说话了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们爬上畜栏的山谷和瀑布河谷之间隆起的支脉，从最狭的地方跨过瀑布河。电线有时架在较低的树枝上，有时就在地面上拖着，引导着他们。工程师认为陌生人的住处可能就在山谷的尽头，大概电线到那里就到头了。
然而事实完全不是那样。他们不得不爬上西南的支脉，再下降到贫瘠的高地上来；高地的尽头就是奇形怪状的、荒凉的玄武岩峭壁了。居民们不时弯下腰来摸索电线；事实上现在已经可以肯定，电线是一直通到大海去的。他们长久以来一直没有找到的住所，一定就在沿海一带的岩石深处。
天空简直象着了火似的。电光不断地闪耀着。有几道闪电就打在浓烟环抱的火山顶上。火山好象喷起火来。快到十一点钟的时候，居民们来到了俯临西边大洋的峭壁上。起风了。在五百英尺以下的地方，浪涛翻腾着。
根据史密斯的估计，他们离开畜栏已经有一英里半了。
电线沿着峡谷的一面悬崖，从一大堆岩石里拉了进去。岩石勉强保持住平衡，居民们顺着电线，冒险从上面走过去。这里随时都有掉在海里的危险，特别是下坡非常困难，但是他们没有考虑危险；他们已经没法控制自己了。一种不可抗拒的力量，象吸铁石似的，吸引着他们向那个神秘的地方走去。
这个峡谷，即使在白天也是很难通行的，但是他们却几乎自己也不知道怎么走的，居然从峡谷里走了下去。
他们在亮光中穿行着，岩石纷纷地滚在地上，迸发出火星来，象一个个的大火球。史密斯在前面领路，艾尔通跟在后头。他们一步一步地往前走。他们一会儿在又湿又滑的石头上摔倒下去，一会儿又挣扎起来，继续往前爬行。
电线突然拐到海滩上的岩石那儿去了。海滩上布满了暗礁，波涛不时冲刷着岩石。居民们已经到了玄武岩峭壁的尽头。
这里有一道狭窄的分水岭，它和海面保持着平行的水平方向。居民们沿着电线，在分水岭上往前走。不到一百步，分水岭平缓地降落到海面来了。
工程师在暗中摸索，发现电线钻入了海底。
他的伙伴们都楞住了。
他们大叫起来，感到十分灰心，几乎是绝望了！难道他们必须钻到水里去找海底的洞穴吗？按当时感情冲动的情况看来，他们毫不犹豫是会这样去做的。
工程师拦住了大家。
他把伙伴们领到一个石洞里。
“等一会儿，”他说。“现在潮水正高。落潮的时候，路就会现出来的。”
“你怎么知道的……”潘克洛夫问道。
“要是我们没法到他那儿去，他就不会要我们来了！”
赛勒斯•史密斯的口气充满了信心，谁也没有反对。况且，他的看法也是合乎逻辑的。峭壁底下很可能有一个洞穴，虽然在目前涨潮的时候被海水淹没了，但是只要潮水落下去，就可以通行的。
他们还要等很久。居民们默默地蜷缩在一个深洞里。这时候，倾盆大雨开始直泻下来，雷声从山石间发出轰隆隆的回响。
居民们的情绪非常高涨。他们的脑海里产生了无数稀奇古怪的念头。他们估计会看见一个相貌堂堂、和凡人不一样的神灵，因为只有这样的人才符合他们想象中岛上的神秘圣人。
到午夜的时候，史密斯拿着灯到海滩下面去探测。
果然不出工程师所料。水落下去以后，露出一个庞大的洞口。电线折过一个直角，从洞口进入了开阔的港湾。
赛勒斯•史密斯回到伙伴们身边来，简单地说：
“再过一个钟头，洞里就可以通行了。”
“那么，真的有洞吗？”潘克洛夫问道。
“你还不相信吗？”史密斯回问了一句。
“可是洞里的水位一定会相当高的。”赫伯特说。
“我认为有两种可能性，一种是洞里一点水也没有，可以让我们徒步走进去，一种是虽然有水，但是有交通工具供给我们使用。”史密斯说。
一个钟头过去了。大家冒雨爬到海面上。这时候水面上露出的洞口已经有八英尺了，象一个桥孔似的，奔腾澎湃的波涛在下面汹涌着。
工程师弯下身去，只见有一个黑色的东西在水面漂浮。他把它拉过来。原来是一只系在洞内尖石上的小船。船身包着铁皮，里面放着两把桨。
“上船！”史密斯说。
居民们立刻都上了船。纳布和艾尔通把着桨，潘克洛夫掌着舵。赛勒斯•史密斯在船头拿着灯照路。
小船最初经过一个椭圆形的檐顶，然后顶部突然升高了。但是周围一片漆黑，灯光又暗，既看不出洞的宽度、长度和高度，又没法知道它有多深。这个玄武岩的洞窟里一点声音也没有。外面的声音——甚至连隆隆的雷声——也没法透过它的厚壁，传到里面来。
世界上很多地方都有这种庞大的洞窟。它们是在地球的地质时代形成的天然地窖。有的里面灌满了海水。有的里西藏着整个的湖泊。这样的洞窟很多，例如赫布里底群岛中史泰法岛上的芬加尔山洞；布列塔尼半岛上道亚尼尼士港马甲特的洞窟；科西嘉岛波尼法西俄港的洞窟；挪威来福德的洞窟；以及肯特基州的五百英尺高、二十多英里长的庞大的曼摩斯山洞！自然界在世界各地开凿了这些山洞，供人们欣赏。
居民们现在探测的洞窟是不是一直通到荒岛的中心呢？工程师不时发出简短的指示，潘克洛夫按指示驾船，弯弯曲曲地走了一刻钟。突然，工程师命令道：
“再偏右一些！”
小船改变了方向，贴近右壁前进。工程师想知道电线是不是还沿着这一边向洞里通过去。
电线还钉在这里的岩石上。
“往前走！”史密斯说。
小船由两桨推动着，在黑黝黝的水里前进。
他们又往前划了一刻钟，这时候离洞口大约有半英里了，只听见史密斯又喊道：
“打住！”
小船停下来了。只见一道夺目的光芒照亮了庞大的洞窟，这个洞窟深深地开凿在荒岛的地心。居民们从来也没有想到竟有这样一个地方。
在一百英尺的头顶上，高悬着圆形的拱顶，许多玄武岩的石柱支撑着。这些数不清的石柱从地球形成的最初年代就竖立起来了，柱子上有许多参差不齐的穹窿和奇形怪状的花边。玄武岩的栋梁一个套着一个，高度从四十英尺到五十英尺不等。尽管洞外的怒潮正在奔腾，这里面的海水却总是平静地冲刷着栋梁的底部。工程师指出明亮光源，它照遍了整个洞窟，所有石壁都被照得一片光亮。
在亮光的照耀下，水波也反映出片片银光，小船好象在上下两片光亮夺目的地带之间漂浮着。
中心光源向四面八方发射出光芒，它清清楚楚地照亮了洞里的每一个角落，每一块凸出的岩石。这种光的性质是瞒不过居民们的。这是一种电力的光源，从它那银白的颜色上就足以说明这一点。它是洞里的太阳，它照亮了整个的洞窟。
赛勒斯•史密斯做了一个手势，双桨又划起来了。溅起的水花，恰象一阵阵珠光宝气的细雨。小船朝着光源驶去，现在离那里已经不到半锚链了。
这里的水面宽度将近三百五十英尺。在耀眼的光源后面，有一大片玄武岩的石壁，完全堵住了那边的出路。洞窟的这部分相当宽大，海水形成一个小湖。穹顶、四壁、尽头的悬崖、全部的棱柱和尖顶都浸浴在电光里，它们被照耀得灿烂夺目，好象光就是从它们本身发出来似的。
湖中心浮着一个长长的、象雪茄烟似的东西。它一动也不动，静静地躺在水面上。亮光从它的两边发出来，就好象是从两个白热的炉灶里放射出来的一样。它的外形象一只庞大的鲸鱼，长约二百五十英尺，高出水面十到十二英尺。
小船慢慢地向它驶近了。赛勒斯•史密斯站在船头望着，兴奋得几乎不能自制。然后，他突然抓住通讯记者的胳膊，叫道：
“是他！一定是他！他……”
然后，他往下一坐，喃喃地说出一个名字。只有吉丁•史佩莱听见他说的是什么。
通讯记者显然是知道这个名字的，因为他听了以后，马上起了一种奇怪的反应，接着，他沙哑地说：
“他！那个逍遥自在的人！”
“是他！”史密斯说。
在工程师的指挥下，小船到这个奇怪的漂浮物旁边来了。他们停靠在它的左边，这里有一道光芒透过厚厚的玻璃射出来。
史密斯和他的伙伴们登上平台。这里有一个敞开的仓口。大家一齐从仓口冲下去。
扶梯的尽头是一片甲板，上面有电灯照耀着。甲板的尽头有一扇门，史密斯上去把门打开。
这是一间装饰得富丽堂皇的屋子。居民们迅速穿过这间屋子，走进隔壁的书房，在书房里，从明亮的天花板上投下一片光辉。
书房的尽头是一扇大门，也是关着的，工程师打开了门。
这是一间非常宽敞的大厅。它象博物馆似的，陈列着各种珍贵的矿物制成品、艺术品和神奇的工业品。居民们看见这许多东西，几乎以为自己忽然到了“太虚幻境”了。
他们看见在一张高贵的沙发上有一个人躺着，那个人似乎根本没有注意他们进来。
这时候史密斯开口了。他的伙伴们感到十分惊讶，只听见他说：
“尼摩船长，是您要我们来的吗？我们来了。”
Book 3 Chapter 16
At these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell upon his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance commanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.
His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just risen. He appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful, as he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,--
"Sir, I have no name."
"Nevertheless, I know you!" replied Cyrus Harding.
Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he were about to annihilate him.
Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,--
"After all, what matters now?" he murmured; "I am dying!"
Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his hand--it was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb stood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.
Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and the reporter to be seated.
All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that being whom they had styled the "genius of the island," the powerful protector whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude! Their eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where Pencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!
But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why had the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name which he had believed known to none?--
The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his arm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him.
"You know the name I formerly bore, sir?" he asked.
"I do," answered Cyrus Harding, "and also that of this wonderful submarine vessel--"
"The 'Nautilus'?" said the captain, with a faint smile.
"The 'Nautilus.'"
"But do you--do you know who I am?"
"I do."
"It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with the inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of the sea, the only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have betrayed my secret?"
"A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who, consequently, cannot be accused of treachery."
"The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years since?"
"The same."
"He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the midst of which the 'Nautilus' was struggling?"
"They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,' which contains your history."
"The history of a few months only of my life!" interrupted the captain impetuously.
"It is true," answered Cyrus Harding, "but a few months of that strange life have sufficed to make you known."
"As a great criminal, doubtless!" said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile curling his lips. "Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!"
The engineer was silent.
"Well, sir?"
"It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo," answered Cyrus Harding, "at any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the world, ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their causes; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!"
"It is I," answered the captain simply.
The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words.
Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show.
"Wait till you have heard all," he said.
And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his life.
His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole remaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending against extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,--
"It is useless," he said; "my hours are numbered."
Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the then independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten years of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long degraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.
From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by Nature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of every kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were extensive and profound.
He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to be everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him no attractions. Though young and possessed of every personal advantage, he was ever grave--somber even--devoured by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened people.
Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings. He became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a philosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a statesman versed in the policy of European courts. To the eyes of those who observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those cosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those opulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place to place, and are of no country.
The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title of "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." Here, therefore, will apply the observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard to the discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note already published on this point.
This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing the hope instilled into him from his earliest days.
Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than that by which he was inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they tenderly loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking to carry out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At length, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself.
Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more unscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they might successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had established peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and gross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.
In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the belief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the object of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause. He aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life equally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was ten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it not, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the atrocious mutiny was brought to an end.
Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger, and if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from without, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would have been a thing of the past.
The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought openly and without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he managed to escape from his pursuers.
Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards. The sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again under the rule of England.
Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the mountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome by disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey to profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the civilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some score of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving no trace behind.
Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth? Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could follow.
The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the Pacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was constructed from his designs. By methods which will at some future day be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed for all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving, lighting, and heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its myriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not only all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its depths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew--and thus was his most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication with the earth. He named his submarine vessel the "Nautilus," called himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the seas.
During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to pole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible riches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations who fought for the independence of their country.
(This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in
fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)
For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow- creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were cast on board his vessel. They were a French professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place between the "Nautilus" and the United States frigate "Abraham Lincoln," which had chased her.
Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the "Nautilus," taken now for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.
He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of doing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues under the sea.
One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of the past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the "Nautilus's" boats. But as at this time the "Nautilus" was drawn into the vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain naturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast on shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered them assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had published that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the "Nautilus" were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the public.
For a long time alter this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus, traversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found their last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the Pacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.
He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in navigating the "Nautilus" towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes served him as a harbor.
One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this moment furnished an asylum to the "Nautilus."
The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no longer, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his former companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon which carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in his diving dress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables' length from the shore of the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea. Moved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.
His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways; but his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of the basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could no longer pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar, there was not enough for the "Nautilus," whose draught of water was considerable.
Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men thrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be himself discovered by them. By degrees he became interested in their efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by the ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the secrets of their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily reach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from them the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the abolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.
Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought back the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the lake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many things useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at the time of the attack by the baboons, who made known the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the bottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the secret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures. Thus were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and which all proved the generosity and power of the captain.
Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges still further. There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and, his heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are aware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the "Nautilus," by means of a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name of Nemo.
The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then spoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent an influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and himself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.
But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--
"Now, sir," said he, "now that you know my history, your judgment!"
In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which the French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and terrible sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the professor and his two companions, the "Nautilus," being chased by a frigate in the north of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy.
Cyrus Harding understood the captain's allusion, and was silent.
"It was an enemy's frigate," exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for an instant into the Prince Dakkar, "an enemy's frigate! It was she who attacked me--I was in a narrow and shallow bay--the frigate barred my way-- and I sank her!"
A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,--
"What think you of my life, gentlemen?"
Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied gravely, "Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress. It is one of those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results."
The old man's breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,--
"Was I wrong, or in the right?" he murmured.
Cyrus Harding replied, "All great actions return to God, from whom they are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn your loss."
Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed his hand.
A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. "My child," he said, "may God bless you!"
躺在沙发上的人听了以后，站起身来。电灯光照在他的脸上，他的面貌端庄，高高的额头，眼光炯炯有神，雪白的胡子，头发又多又长，一直垂到肩膀上。
他从长沙发上站起身来，一只手还撑着椅背。他的态度十分安详。看得出来，他的体力已经由于患病而逐渐衰弱了。但是他说话的声音还很洪亮，他带着十分惊讶的口吻，说着英国话：
“先生，我没有名字。”
“可是我知道您！”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
尼摩船长用锐利的眼光盯着工程师，好象要把他吞下去似的。
然后，他又靠到长沙发的垫子上去了。
“算了吧！现在没有什么关系！”他喃喃地说，“反正我快死了！”
赛勒斯•史密斯走到船长身边，吉丁•史佩莱握着他的手——从手的温度可以知道，他发着高烧。艾尔通、潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布在较远的角落里恭恭敬敬地站着。这个豪华的大厅里充满了明亮的电灯光。
这时候尼摩船长把手缩回去，做了一个手势，教工程师和通讯记者坐下。
大家都怀着激动的心情注视着他。在他们面前的就是被大家尊称为“岛上的圣人”的那个人。这个万能的保卫者，在各种不同的场合下，一再援救他们，他的每一次援救都是那样的有效；他们欠下了这位恩人多少的恩情！潘克洛夫和纳布原以为会发现一个超凡入圣的神灵，可是他们看见的不过是一个人，而且是一个快要死的人！
尼摩船长认为谁也不会知道自己的名字，可是，赛勒斯•史密斯怎么会知道他的呢？为什么他听到这个名字，就要突然站起身来呢？
船长又重新躺在长沙发上了。他把头搁在一条胳膊上，望着坐在旁边的工程师。
“您知道我过去的名字，先生？”他问道。
“是的，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“还有这只神奇的潜水船的名字……”
“您是说诺第留斯号吗？”船长微弱地笑了一下。
“是的，诺第留斯号！”
“可是您……您知道我是谁吗？”
“知道的。”
“我和人间隔绝往来已经多年了。我在海底度过了漫长的三十年，这是我找到的唯一的自由的地方！谁居然泄漏了我的秘密呢？”
“是一个不在您约束之下的人，尼摩船长，因此不能怪他背信。”
“是十六年前偶然来到我船上的那个法国人吗？”
“他们没有死，并且还写了一本名叫《海底两万里》的书，叙述您的历史。”
“那仅仅是我一生中几个月的历史！”船长急躁地打断了他的话。
“不错，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“但是，这几个月奇怪的生活已经足够使人们了解您……”
“是一个罪人，是吧？”尼摩船长说，他的唇边露出一丝高傲的微笑。“是的，也许是一个人类唾弃的暴徒！”
工程师没有开口。
“是不是，先生？”
“这不该由我来判断，尼摩船长，”赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“至少是关于您过去的生活。我和世界上其他的人一样，不知道您为什么要选择这种奇怪的生活方式。在不了解情况以前，我也不能对事情的结果加以判断。可是，自从我们来到林肯岛以后。始终有人伸出善意的手保护着我们，由于有了这个善良、慷慨而又万能的人的帮助，才保全了我们的生命，而这个善良、慷慨而万能的人就是您，尼摩船长，这一点我是知道的！”
“是我。”船长简单地说。
工程师和通讯记者立刻站起身来。这时候，伙伴们也已经靠拢来了。他们打算用语言和神情来表达内心的感激。
尼摩船长做了一个手势制止他们。他掩饰不住激动的心情，向大家说：
“等你们把故事听完吧。”
于是船长简单地叙述了他生平的往事。
他的叙事很短，然而他却不得不振作起最后的全副精力把故事说完。十分明显，他在和极度衰弱的体格作斗争。赛勒斯•史密斯几次恳求他休息一会儿，但是他摇了摇头，好象再也活不到明天了。当通讯记者提出要给他医治的时候，他说：
“没有用，我已经是快死的人了。”
尼摩船长是印度的达卡王子，当时本德尔汗德还保持着独立，他就是本德尔汗德君主的儿子，印度英雄第波•萨伊布的侄子。十岁的时候，他的父亲把他送往欧洲去受全面的教育，打算将来依靠他有了才能和学识，来领导全国人民和压迫者进行斗争。
达卡王子天资聪明，从十岁到三十岁，他积累了各方面的知识，在科学、文学和艺术方面都有高深的造诣。
他漫游了整个的欧洲。由于他出身贵族，又富有资财，因此到处有人奉迎。但是，任何诱惑都不能引起他的兴趣。他虽然年轻、英俊，他却总是非常严肃、沉默。他的求知欲十分强烈。他内心燃烧着复仇的火焰。
那时候，达卡王子心里充满了愤怒。他憎恨一个国家，一个他从来也不愿意去的国家；他仇视一个民族，他始终拒绝跟他们妥协。他痛恨英国，同样地他也非常注意英国。
他所以这样，是因为作为一个被征服者，他对于征服者抱着血海深仇，侵略者从被侵略者那里是得不到宽恕的。达卡王子是第波•萨伊布家族中的成员，他的父亲是一位只是在名义上臣服联合王国的君主，因此，他是在恢复主权和报仇雪恨的思想影响下成长起来的。他热爱自己的祖国，他的祖国象诗一样的美丽，然而却受着英国殖民者的奴役。他从来也不踏上他所诅咒的、奴役着印度人民的英国人的土地。
达卡王子成了一个很有修养的艺术家，懂得各种高深的科学的学者和通晓欧洲各国宫廷政策的政治家。单从表面来看，人们也许会把他看成一个埋头学习而轻视行动的世界主义者，一个阔气的旅客——目空一切、自命清高、心无祖国和走遍天涯的人。
事实上，他完全不是那样的人。这位艺术家、科学家、政治家有着一颗印度人的心，他立志报仇，希望有一天能收回国家的主权，赶走外来的侵略者，恢复祖国的独立。
1849年，达卡王子回到本德尔汗德。他娶了一个印度的贵族女郎。跟他一样，她也为祖国的灾难而感到愤慨。他们生了两个孩子，夫妇俩都非常喜爱他们。但是，幸福的家庭生活并没有使他们忘记印度的解放事业。他等待着机会。最后，机会终于来了。
也许是英国对印度的奴役和压榨太重了，群众纷纷对英国殖民者表示不满，这给达卡王子带来了有利的条件。他把自己对外国侵略者的仇恨，深深地铭刻在广大人民群众的心中。他不仅走遍印度半岛上仍旧保持独立的地方，而且来到了直接受英国统治的地区。他重新带来了第波•萨伊布为捍卫祖国而在赛林加帕坦英勇牺牲的伟大日子。
1857年，印度士兵爆发了武装起义，达卡王子是这次起义的中心人物，他组织了这次大规模的抗英运动。他为这事业贡献了自己的能力和资财。他身先士卒，站在战斗的最前线。他很谦逊，他和那些为解放祖国而斗争的英雄一样，从没想到过自己的生命。他参加过二十次战役，受伤过十次。终于，英国的枪炮打死了最后一批起义战士，但他却逃出了虎口。
英国在印度的势力从来也没有遭到过这样的危机。要是印度士兵真象他们所希望的那样，得到了外来的援助，那么，联合王国在亚洲的势力恐怕就要崩溃了。
那时候，达卡王子的名字人人都知道。这位英雄并不躲藏，他公开作战。英国当局悬赏要他的头颅，虽然没有人出卖他，但是他的父母妻儿却在他还不知道他们为他所冒的危险以前，就作了他的替身。
这一次，正义的事业又一次被暴力镇压下去了。但是，文明是永远不会倒退的，客观规律必然推动着文明前进。印度士兵的起义失败了，从前的印度君主的土地又沦于英国更黑暗的统治。
达卡王子逃脱虎口，回到本德尔汗德的深山中。从此以后，他就一个人生活在那里。他不仅对人类的一切表示厌恶，而且对文明世界也充满了仇恨，他永远也不想再回到世界上去了。他变卖了自己剩余的财产，集结了二十几个最忠实的同伴，在某一天一起失踪了。
那么，他到哪里去找文明世界上所找不到的自由了呢？在水底下，在海洋的深处，人们没法追踪他的地方。
这位军事家变成了学者。他在太平洋的一个荒岛上建立了造船所，按照自己的设计，造成一艘潜水船。他用某些方法——这些方法将来是会被人们发现的——有效地利用了万能的电力。他用电作为动力、照明和发热的源泉，供应他的浮力装置的全部需要，而这种电的来源却永远不会枯竭。海里有无尽的宝藏，有数不清的鱼类、无数的海藻和庞大的哺乳动物，不仅有自然界所供应的一切，还有人类遗失在海底的各种各样的物资。这些宝藏充分地满足了王子和他的同伴们的需要。于是他最热心向往的事就这样实现了，他再也不和外界联系了。他把他的潜水船命名为诺第留斯号，自称尼摩船长，神不知鬼不觉地隐藏在海洋深处。
多年来，这个神奇的人从南极到北极，游遍了各个大洋。作为一个被文明世界所遗弃的人，他在这些陌生的地方搜集了无数的珍宝。1702年，西班牙大帆船在维哥湾所丧失的百万资财成了他用不完的财富。他经常用这笔巨款来帮助那些为争取独立而奋斗的国家，同时却始终不暴露自己的姓名。
很久以来，他一直和外界隔绝。1866年11月6日的夜间，忽然有三个人落到他的船上。一个是法国教授，一个是教授的仆人，还有一个是加拿大的渔夫。当时美国的亚伯拉罕•林肯号巡洋舰追逐诺第留斯号，这三个人就是在两船互撞的时候，落到他的船上来的。
尼摩部长听教授说起，才知道诺第留斯号有时被人们当作庞大的鲸鱼类哺乳动物，有时被人们当作一只海盗的潜水船，到处都有人在海里搜寻它。
这三个人偶然从大洋里来到船上，接触到他的神秘生活；本来他是可以把他们送回大洋的。但是他没有这样做，竟把他们软禁起来。他们在这里呆了七个月，在海底航行了两万法里，这个期间所遭遇的一切奇迹，他们都亲眼看到了。
这三个人谁也不知道尼摩船长过去的历史。1867年6月22日，他们乘着诺第留斯号上的一只小船逃走了。可是当时诺第留斯号在挪威海岸附近被卷入了大漩涡的中心。因此，船长十分自然地认为这三个逃跑的人一定会被可怕的漩涡卷走，死在海里了。他决没想到那个法国人和他的两个伙伴竟那么凑巧，被抛上海岸，并且得到了罗佛敦群岛渔民们的救援，更不知道法国教授回国以后，出版了一本书，叙述了七个月来在诺第留斯号上曲折离奇的航海经过。这些情况公开以后，曾经引起广大读者的好奇心。
在这件事情发生以后很长的一段时间里，尼摩船长继续漫游各个海洋。但是他的同伴一个一个地死去了，他们最后在太平洋的珊瑚礁上找到了长眠的基地。后来，这群寄居在海底的人，只剩下尼摩船长一个人了。
这时候他已经六十岁了。虽然无依无靠，但他还是把诺第留斯号开进了一个海底的石洞，过去他常常把这样的石洞当作停泊船只的海港。
这些港口，有一个就在林肯岛的海底下，那时候它已成为诺第留斯号的藏身的处所。
船长在林肯岛已经居住了六年。他不再航海，只是静等着度完自己残余的岁月。这时候他应该回到过去的同胞那去了；也就是在这个时候，他无意之中看见南军的俘虏乘坐的气球从天空降落下来。他穿着潜水衣在离岸几锚链的海底行走，恰好赶上工程师掉下海来。船长在同情心的驱使下，救起了赛勒斯•史密斯。
他首先想到的是远远避开这五个遇难的人。但是，火山的作用使一部分玄武岩升出水面，堵塞住他藏身的海港，他再也出不了地窟了。虽然轻便的小船不怕水浅，还能穿出洞口，但是诺第留斯号却不行，因为它吃水很深。
于是尼摩船长只好留下来。他注意这些赤手空拳、一无所有的荒岛上的落难人，但是他又不打算暴露自己。后来他逐渐发现这些人诚实、勇敢而且团结友爱，他关心他们的奋斗。他情不由己地去了解他们生活中的疾苦。他穿着潜水衣，可以毫不困难地到“花岗石宫”内部的井底，沿着凸出的岩石爬到井口去。就这样，他听到居民们回忆过去的往事，谈论目前和将来的情况。他从他们那里知道，为了废除奴隶制，美国国内发生了大规模的内战。是的，这些人在岛上的光明磊落的行为是可以改变尼摩船长对人的看法的。
尼摩部长救活了赛勒斯•史密斯；他还把托普从湖里救出来，又把它领到“石窟”那儿去；把箱子装满许多对居民们有用的东西放在遗物角，把平底船送回慈悲河；在猩猩进攻“花岗石宫”的时候，把绳梯从上面扔下来，把纸条装在瓶子里，使他们知道艾尔通在达抱岛上，把水雷放在海峡底下，引起双桅船的爆炸；给居民们送硫酸奎宁，把赫伯特从垂死的情况下挽救过来；最后他还用电弹打死了罪犯，他掌握这种电弹秘密，这种电弹是他用来猎捕海底动物的。这样，许许多多看起来显得神妙莫测的事情都解释清楚了。这一切都说明船长的慷慨和才能。
然而，这位伟大的愤世嫉俗的人热衷于一切善举。他还要把一些有益的意见告诉他的受惠人；另一方面，他心脏跳得厉害，觉得他死期逼近了。干是，就象我们所知道的那样，他用一根从畜栏通到诺第留斯号的电线，把“花岗石宫”的居民们邀请到这里来。要是他早知道赛勒斯•史密斯熟悉他的历史，会用尼摩船长的名字称呼他，他也许就不会请他们来了。
船长讲完了他的一生。接着赛勒斯•史密斯开口了。他追溯过去发生的每一件事，这些事情，对于小队说来都有极大的好处。他代表伙伴们和他自己向这位慷慨的义士致谢。
但是尼摩船长却不关心这个。他的脑子里似乎盘算着一件事。他没有握工程师伸过来的手，只是说：
“现在，先生，您知道我的历史了，你判断一下吧！”
船长显然是暗指一件重要的事情才这样说的，这件事情是落在他船上的那三个陌生人亲眼看到的；法国教授当然已经把它写在自己的作品里，而且所起的影响一定是很大的。这件事情就是：在教授和他的两个伙伴逃脱以前不久，诺第留斯号在北大西洋受到一艘巡洋舰的追逐，最后它象一只撞墙车似的毫不留情地把巡洋舰撞沉了。
赛勒斯•史密斯懂得船长的暗示，他没有回答。
“那是一艘英国人的巡洋舰，先生，”尼摩船长大声说，一刹那，他又变成达卡王子了。“是英国人的巡洋舰！您要知道，是它来攻击我的！我被挤在一个又狭又浅的海湾里……我必须闯过去，于是……我就闯过去了！”
后来，他很镇静地说：“我是主张正义和公理的，无论在哪里，我都尽力做我能做的好事，同时也干我应当干的‘坏事’。要知道，正义并不等于宽恕！”
接着沉默了一会儿；然后船长又问了一遍：
“你们对我怎样看法，先生们？”
赛勒斯•史密斯向船长伸出了手，严肃地答道，“先生，您的错误是在于您认为过去的事还能重来，你抗拒了必然的趋势。这样的错误有人赞美，也有人责难；只有上帝能判断是非，而从人情上说，是应该得到原谅的。一个人错以为自己想做的是对的，这种人，人们可以攻击他，但是人们还是尊敬他。您的错误并不能使您失掉别人的钦佩，您的名字丝毫也不用害怕历史的判断。历史喜爱英勇豪迈的事迹，同时也谴责这种事迹所造成的后果。”
尼摩船长的胸膛激动地起伏着，他把手举起来指着天空，喃喃地说：
“我错了还是对了呢？”
赛勒斯•史密斯回答说，“一切伟大的事业从上帝那里来，最后还要回到上帝那里去。尼摩船长，您救了我们这些老实人，我们将要永远怀念您。”
赫伯特已经走近船长。他跪下来，吻了船长的手。
垂死人的眼睛里噙着晶莹的泪水。
“我的孩子，”他说，“上帝保佑你！”
Book 3 Chapter 17
Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the artificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the "Nautilus" was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel.
An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back upon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the "Nautilus" which millions could not have purchased, and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching.
During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed the condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in the heart and head.
The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors.
"We can do nothing," said Gideon Spilett.
"But of what is he dying?" asked Pencroft.
"Life is simply fading out," replied the reporter.
"Nevertheless," said the sailor, "if we move him into the open air, and the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover."
"No, Pencroft," answered the engineer, "it is useless to attempt it. Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He has lived for a dozen years on board the 'Nautilus,' and on board the 'Nautilus' he desires to die."
Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding's reply, for he raised himself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,--
"You are right, sir," he said. "I shall die here--it is my wish; and therefore I have a request to make of you."
Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man.
They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling. He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from the splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d'oeuvres of the Italian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and bronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the after-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful productions of the sea-- marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device, inscribed over the pediment of the museum--the motto of the "Nautilus"--
"Mobilis in mobile."
His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas.
Cyrus Harding respected the captain's silence, and waited till he should speak.
After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his whole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,
"You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?"
"Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours."
"Promise, then," continued Captain Nemo, "to carry out my last wishes, and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you."
"We promise," said Cyrus Harding.
And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.
"Gentlemen," resumed the captain, "to-morrow I shall be dead."
Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain arrested him.
"To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the 'Nautilus.' It is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their resting-place shall be mine."
These words were received with profound silence.
"Pay attention to my wishes," he continued. "The 'Nautilus' is imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but, although egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the abyss, and there bury my remains."
The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.
"To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding," continued the captain, "yourself and companions will leave the 'Nautilus,' for all the treasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted. That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a future day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but that they will prosper."
After a few moments' repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness, Captain Nemo continued,--
"To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the 'Nautilus,' and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the vessel."
"It shall be done, captain," answered Cyrus Harding.
"Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but, before leaving the 'Nautilus,' go to the stern and there open two large stop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will penetrate into the reservoirs, and the 'Nautilus' will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss."
And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,--
"Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!"
Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they had nothing to do but to conform to them.
"I have your promise, gentlemen?" added Captain Nemo.
"You have, captain," replied the engineer.
The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave him for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the event of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, "I shall live until to-morrow, sir."
All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and arrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was established, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical power of the "Nautilus."
The "Nautilus" was a masterpiece containing masterpieces with itself, and the engineer was struck with astonishment.
The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above the water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and in which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the "Nautilus" over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance.
Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they were vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their hearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often aided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at the point of death.
Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince Dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface.
"What a man!" said Pencroft. "Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found peace there any more than elsewhere!"
"The 'Nautilus,'" observed Ayrton, "might have enabled us to leave Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country."
"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Pencroft, "I for one would never risk myself in such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!"
"I believe, Pencroft," answered the reporter, "that the navigation of a submarine vessel such as the 'Nautilus' ought to be very easy, and that we should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no lee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the ocean are as calm as those of a lake."
"That may be," replied the sailor, "but I prefer a gale of wind on board a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not beneath it."
"My friends," said the engineer, "it is useless, at any rate as regards the 'Nautilus,' to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The 'Nautilus' is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it. Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of the fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo's wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it."
After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his companions again descended to the interior of the "Nautilus." There they took some refreshment and returned to the saloon.
Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile even curled his lips.
The colonists drew around him.
"Gentlemen," said the captain, "you are brave and honest men. You have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed your conduct. I have esteemed you--I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr. Harding."
Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it affectionately.
"It is well!" he murmured.
He resumed,--
"But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to leave it?"
"To return, captain!" answered Pencroft quickly.
"To return, Pencroft?" said the captain, with a smile. "I know, it is true, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now is, and it seems to you a paradise!"
"Our project, captain," interposed Cyrus Harding, "is to annex it to the United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately situated in this part of the Pacific."
"Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen," continued the captain; "your toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One's native land!--there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I loved!"
"You have some last wish to transmit," said the engineer with emotion, "some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains of India?"
"No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race, and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.--But to return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and beyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live alone! You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln Island, and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those wretches have destroyed the vessel you have built."
"We propose to construct a vessel," said Gideon Spilett, "sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner or later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too many recollections ever to forget it."
"It is here that we have known Captain Nemo," said Cyrus Harding.
"It is here only that we can make our home!" added Herbert.
"And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if--" replied the captain.
He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said simply,--
"Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you--alone!"
The engineer's companions, respecting the wish, retired.
Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him.
Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness.
The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the "Nautilus" for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish it from day in the cavern.
Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents of his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold.
Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death.
At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death.
By one o'clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, "God and my country!" he quietly expired.
Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.
Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton's eyes. Neb was on his knees by the reporter's side, motionless as a statue.
Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead, said solemnly, "May his soul be with God!" Turning to his friends, he added, "Let us pray for him whom we have lost!"
Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain by carrying out his dying wishes.
Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the "Nautilus," taking with them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which contained wealth amounting to millions.
The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the "Nautilus."
The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the side of the submarine vessel.
The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line, were two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in the submersion of the vessel.
The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the "Nautilus," slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.
But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves. The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while the cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of electric light faded away, and soon after the "Nautilus," now the tomb of Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed.
天亮了，但是曙光照不到洞窟的深处。这时候正在涨潮，海水淹没了洞窟的入口。从诺第留斯号的天窗里射出去的人造光还是和原来一样照向远处，光亮夺目，浮船周围的海水泛起一片银波。
这时候尼摩船长精疲力竭地倒在长沙发上。打算把他搬到“花岗石宫”里去住是不行的，因为他已经表示过，要和那些无价之宝守在一起，在诺第留斯号里等待即将到来的死亡。
尼摩船长虚脱了很长时间，几乎完全失去了知觉。赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱小心地观察了这个垂死的人的情况。他的体力显著地衰退着。过去一度强壮有力的身躯，现在成了一个即将出窍的灵魂寄托的躯壳了。他的全部的生命都集中在心脏和头脑里。
工程师和通讯记者悄悄地商量了一下。还能帮助这个垂死的人吗？即使不能挽救他的生命，能不能使他多活几天呢？他说过自己是已经没法救活的人了，他毫不害怕地静等着死亡。
“我们没有办法了。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“可是他死的原因是什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道。
“一句话，生命衰退了。”通讯记者回答说。
“不过，”水手说，“要是我们把他抬到外面阳光底下去，吸些新鲜空气，他也许会好过来的。”
“不，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答说，“这种尝试是没有用的。再说，尼摩船长决不会答应离开他的船。他在诺第留斯号上已经住了三十年了，他死也要死在这里。”
尼摩船长一定听见赛勒斯•史密斯的话了。他稍稍抬起身子。他的声音更加微弱，但却始终是那么清楚。
“你说得对，先生，”他说。“我要死在这里……这是我的愿望。我对你有一个请求。”
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴都到长沙发旁边来了。这时他们把坐垫给他放好，让垂死的人躺得更舒服一些。
电灯的亮光透过天花板上的花玻璃照亮了整个的大厅。他们只见船长在观看房里的奇珍异宝。他依次观赏了美丽的隔板挂毡上的图画——那些意大利、佛兰达斯、法兰西和西班牙大师的杰作；雕像座上的大理石像和铜像；贴近后半部隔板的华丽的风琴，饲养着各种珍奇水族的养鱼缸——里面有海藻、植虫、极其名贵的珍珠项圈；最后，他的目光停留在这个博物馆的人字墙上，上面刻着题铭，那是诺第留斯号的一句箴言：
“动中之动。”
他带着珍惜的神情观看这些艺术界和自然界的珍品，似乎这是最后的一眼了。他多年来寄居在大海深处，所看到的就仅限于这些东西。
赛勒斯•史密斯没有打扰船长的沉思，等待他重新开口。
过了几分钟——在这几分钟之内，他无疑是在回顾自己的一生——尼摩船长转过来对居民们说：
“各位先生，你们认为对我应该尽什么义务吗？”
“船长，相信我们，假如能延长您的寿命的话，我们情愿献出我们的生命。”
“那么，”尼摩船长接着说，“你们只要答应我实现我最后的愿望，就算报答了我为你们所做的一切了。”
“我们答应您。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
这个诺言把他自己和他的伙伴们都包括在内了。
“各位先生，”船长说，“明天我就要死了。”
赫伯特正要叫出声来，船长做了一个手势，制止了他。
“明天我就要死了。我不希望埋在别处，只求葬在诺第留斯号里。这就是我的坟墓！我的同伴们都长眠在大海的深处，我也要和他们长眠在一起。”
居民们默默地听着他的话。
“尊重我的愿望，”他接着往下说。“这个洞窟的出口堵死了，诺第留斯号困在里面出不去。但是虽然没法出去，至少沉在这个深渊里，把我的遗骸葬在这里是不成问题的。”
居民们恭恭敬敬地听着垂死的人所说的话。
“明天等我死了以后，史密斯先生，”船长说，“您和您的伙伴们就离开诺第留斯号。让全船的财宝作我的陪葬。现在你们已经知道达卡王子的历史了。我只留给你们一件纪念品。那边有一个保险箱，里面装着价值极高的金刚钻。其中大部分都是我做丈夫做父亲的时候留下的纪念品，那时候我还认为有可能玩赏呢。此外，里面还有我和我的朋友们在海底搜集到的许多珍珠。将来你们可以好好地利用这些财宝。史密斯先生，象您和您的伙伴这样的人，决不会因为手里有了钱就产生灾祸的。我‘升天’以后还要参加你们的事业，我相信你们的事业一定会有很大发展的。”
他由于过度虚弱，不得不稍息一会，然后又继续说：
“明天你们把保险箱拿走，离开这间大厅，关上门。然后你们到诺第密斯号的甲板上去，把中仓口放下来，把整个的船完全关闭好。”
“我们一定照办，船长。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“好。然后你们就上你们来的时候坐的那只小船。但是，在离开诺第留斯号以前，不要忘记做一件事：在船尾的吃水线上，有两个大旋塞。你们去把旋塞打开。海水灌进贮水槽以后，诺第留斯号就会逐渐沉到水底下去，躺在大海的深处了。”
船长看见赛勒斯•史密斯的表情，就明白了他心里在怎样想，于是加了一句：
“不必害怕，你们只不过是埋葬一个尸体！”
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴都没有向尼摩船长提出任何建议。船长已经谈出了最后的心愿，他们没有别的事情可做，只等照办了。
“你们答应我了吗，诸位先生？”尼摩船长问道。
“答应您了，船长。”工程师回答说。
船长向居民们做了一个手势，表示感谢，并且要求他们暂时离开这里，让他休息几个钟头。吉丁•史佩莱打算在他身旁陪着他，以防意外，但是垂死的人拒绝了。他说，“我能够活到明天，先生。”
大家离开大厅，经过书房和餐厅，来到前面装设电动仪器的机房。这套仪器不仅能供应电热和照明用电，还能供应诺第留斯号的机械动力。
诺第留斯号本身是一个奇迹，它的内部又包含着许多奇迹。工程师看了以后，不禁诧异得说不出话来。
居民们登上平台，平台高出水面七八英尺。他们在这里看见一个大圆孔，外面嵌着一块很厚的玻璃凸透镜。亮光就是从这里射出来的。圆孔后面一看就知道是舵轮仓。当诺第留斯号在海底航行的时候，舵手就在这里面掌握方向。在航行中，电灯光一定可以照得很远。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们默默地站了一会儿。刚才所看到的和听到的一切给他们留下深刻的印象。他们和这个多次帮助自己的保护者结识了只有几个钟头，现在他马上就要死了，想到这里，他们的心中感到非常难受。
不论后人怎样评定这个不平凡的人的一生，人们还是永远也忘不了达卡王子的形象的。
“多么了不起的人啊！”潘克洛夫说。“他真的可能是生活在海底的吗？我想他在海底所得到的宁静也不会比别处多一些。”
“要是坐上诺第留斯号，”艾尔通说，“我们一定能离开林肯岛，到有人的地方去。”
“我的天！”潘克洛夫叫道，“我决不冒险乘这样的船。在水面上航海，还可以；在水底下，我干不了！”
“我相信，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者说，“象诺第留斯号这样的潜水船一定是很容易驾驶的。我们一定很快就能摸熟它的性能。在海底既不怕暴风雨，又不怕撞船。到海底下几英尺的地方海水就和湖里一样平静了。”
“也许可能，”水手说，“但是我宁愿乘一只装备齐全的船在海上冒着狂风航行。船总是用来在海面上走的，而不是在海底下走的！”
“朋友们，”工程师说，“潜水船的问题没有什么可说的，至少是用不着讨论诺第留斯号的问题。诺第留斯号不是我们的，我们没有权利去处理它。况且我们也决不能利用它。现在洞窟的出口已经被上升的玄武岩堵死了，诺第留斯号根本不可能驶出洞外去。除了这个以外，尼摩船长的愿望是要和它一起葬在海底。他的愿望就是我们的法律，我们一定要按照他的愿望去做。”
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们的谈话继续了相当长时间，然后他们下到诺第留斯号的内部。他们在那里吃了一些东西，又回到大厅里去。
在他们离开以前，尼摩船长曾经陷入虚脱状态；这时候他的精神已经恢复了。他的眼睛放射着原有的光芒。他的嘴边甚至露出一丝微笑。
居民们围在他的身旁。
“诸位先生，”船长说，“你们是既诚实又勇敢的人。你们都为公共的福利尽力。我常常观察你们的行为。过去我尊重你们——现在我仍然尊重你们！让我和您握手吧，史密斯先生！”
赛勒斯•史密斯伸出手来，船长热烈地把它握住了。
“很好！”他喃喃地说。
接着，他又继续说：
“我自己的事情谈得够多的了。现在应该谈谈你们以及和你们所寄居的这个林肯岛有关的问题。你们想离开这个岛吗？”
“我们也想再回来，船长！”潘克洛夫很快地说。
“再回来吗？潘克洛夫？”船长微笑着说。“真的，我知道你爱这个岛。由于你们的努力，这个岛改变了原来的面貌。你们是岛上的主人！”
“船长，”赛勒斯•史密斯插嘴说，“我们打算把它合并到美国，因为它在太平洋里的位置非常有利，我们要把它开辟成一个海港。”
“你们是为自己的祖国着想，先生们，”船长说，“你们为祖国的富强和荣誉而辛勤劳动。你们做得对。一个人——他应该活在祖国！死在祖国！可是我，我死的地方离我所爱的一切太远了！”
“您最后还有什么心愿要我们转达，”工程师感情激动地说，“有什么纪念品要送给您遗留在印度深山里的那些朋友吗？”
“没有，史密斯先生；我没有朋友了！我是我这一代的最后一个，认识我的人以为我早就死了。——还是谈你们的事吧。寂寞和孤独是可怕的，是人们不能忍受的。我曾经认为能够独自生活！……因此，你们应该想尽一切办法离开林肯岛，重新和你们的故乡见面。我知道那些匪徒把你们造的那只船撞毁了。”
“我们打算造一只大船，把我们载送到最近的陆地去，”吉丁•史佩莱说，“不过，就算我们的目的达到了，我们早晚还是要回林肯岛来的。我们留恋这个地方，有许多事情回想起来使我们永远也忘不了它。”
“比方说，我们就是在这里认识尼摩船长的。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“这里是我们唯一能够安家的地方！”赫伯特补充道。
“我要长眠在这里，如果……”船长说。
他没有把话说完，停了片刻，然后简单地说道：
“史密斯先生，我想和您……单独说几句话！”
工程师的伙伴们尊重垂死的人的意见，退出去了。
赛勒斯•史密斯只和尼摩船长谈了几分钟，就又把伙伴们唤了进来。但是他没有把垂死的人吐露给他的私事告诉大家。
这时候，吉丁•史佩莱细心地看护着船长。他耗尽了全身的精力，已经不能和病体顽抗了。
这一天平安无事地过去了。居民们一刻也没有离开诺第留斯号。时间已经到了黑夜，但是在洞窟里，却是分不清黑夜白天的。
尼摩船长并不感到痛苦，他只是显著地衰退着。由于死期到来，他那高贵的面容一点血色也没有了，但他还是显得十分平静。他不时喃喃地呓语，说的都是复杂的经历中所遇到的事情。生命显然在衰退，他的四肢已经发冷了。
偶尔他还和围在旁边的居民说话，向他们露出最后的微笑，这一丝微笑，一直保持到他死后。
午夜刚过，尼摩船长竭尽全力把两臂交叉在胸前，他好象打算在死后保持这个姿势似的。
一点钟的时候，他只剩下目光还有点生气。一向炯炯有光的眼珠里现在露出了垂死的光芒。他喃喃地说着“上帝，祖国！”然后安详地死了。
赛勒斯•史密斯弯下身来，侍奉他归天。达卡王子早成了历史人物，现在连尼摩船长也成过去了。
赫伯特和潘克洛夫放声痛哭。艾尔通默默地流着泪。纳布一动也不动地跪在通讯记者旁边，象一尊雕像似的。
然后，赛勒斯•史密斯把手放在死者的头上，庄严地说：
“但愿他的灵魂回到上帝身边去！为我们死去的恩人祷告吧！”
几个钟头以后，居民们实现了船长临终以前的愿望，履行了他们的诺言。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们拿着恩人留下的唯一纪念品——装有价值亿万的财宝的保险箱，离开了诺第留斯号。
神奇的大厅里仍旧是灯火辉煌，他们小心地关上大厅的门，接着又把通上甲板的铁门严密地关起来，使海水丝毫也透不到诺第留斯号里边去。
然后移民们跳上了系在潜水船旁边的小船。
这时候，他们把小船划到诺第留斯号的船尾。船尾的吃水线附近有两个大旋塞通向贮水槽，这是为了使船下沉而装置的。
他们打开旋塞，海水灌进了贮水槽。诺第留斯号缓缓地往下沉去，最后在湖面上消失了。
居民们还能眼看着它在水里往下沉。船上发出的强烈光芒照亮了半透明的海水，洞窟逐渐黑暗下来。最后，大片的电光消失了，不一会儿，诺第留斯号——现在它已经成了尼摩船长的棺材——沉在海洋的深处了。
Book 3 Chapter 18
At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern, to which they gave the name of "Dakkar Grotto," in memory of Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty under the arcade, washed on the right by the sea.
The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it could run no risk of harm.
The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.
Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken the road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service.
The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the night of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The unknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more. His "Nautilus" and he were buried in the depths of the abyss. To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before. They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral.
Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.
It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be actively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his time and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future lay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great of having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the sea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of need, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be completed, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to Ayrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility of the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest importance that nothing should be neglected on this point.
The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton, assisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably called off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It was important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that is to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable. Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging, that of the "Speedy" having been saved entire, so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.
The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors, to the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at sea.
Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble when one or the other abandoned the carpenter's axe for the gun of the hunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite House, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy Pencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard. when this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by way of venting his feelings, did the work of six men.
The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season. For some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated with electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that the distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but incessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the globe.
The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence, and the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of those gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the southern extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms.
It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers, perceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano.
Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in watching the summit of Mount Franklin.
"Ah!" exclaimed Pencroft, "those are not vapors this time! It seems to me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!"
This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the changes going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months had the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet produced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a grayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above the summit of the mountain.
"The fire is in the chimney," observed Gideon Spilett.
"And we can't put it out!" replied Herbert.
"The volcano ought to be swept," observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly serious.
"Well said, Neb!" cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; "and you'll undertake the job, no doubt?"
Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant muttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone somewhat apart, he said,--
"The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an important change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption."
"Well, captain," said Pencroft, "we shall witness the eruption; and if it is a good one, we'll applaud it. I don't see that we need concern ourselves further about the matter."
"It may be so," replied Cyrus Harding, "for the ancient track of the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto overflowed towards the north. And yet--"
"And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be better it should not take place," said the reporter.
"Who knows?" answered the sailor. "Perhaps there may be some valuable substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may turn to good account!"
Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava, in consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace the wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might present themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk of disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest consequences.
"It seems to me," said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear to the ground, "it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound, like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron."
The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced that Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a subterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly away, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of the globe. But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might therefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage through the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently large, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be apprehended.
"Well, then!" said Pencroft, "are we not going back to work? Let Mount Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb, Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at our work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair of hands would not be too many. Before two months I want our new 'Bonadventure'-- for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?--to float on the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!"
All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft, descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all took part.
They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of January, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not, besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice, large shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried all these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett remarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed the evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption. It was, besides, of the first importance from every point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least possible delay. In presence of the eventualities which might arise, the safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their ship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?
In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke accumulated at the mouth of the crater.
"The crater is on fire!" said Herbert, who, more active than his companion, first reached the plateau.
Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much smoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that their light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor obscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars.
"The change is rapid!" said the engineer.
"That is not surprising," answered the reporter. "The reawakening of the volcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the mountain to discover Captain Nemo's retreat. It was, if I mistake not, about the 15th of October."
"Yes," replied Herbert, "two months and a half ago!"
"The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks," resumed Gideon Spilett, "and it is not to be wondered at that they now break out with such violence!"
"Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?" asked Cyrus Harding.
"Yes," replied Gideon Spilett, "but there is a great difference between that and an earthquake."
"I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake," answered Cyrus Harding, "may God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is simply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the pressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. it is this effect which is being produced at this moment."
"What magnificent flames!" exclaimed Herbert.
At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater, the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of machine-guns.
Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned to Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause.
"Yes, and no," answered Cyrus Harding.
"Nevertheless," continued the reporter, "would not the greatest misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would overturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared, since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet."
"True," replied Cyrus Harding, "and I do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may produce great disasters."
"How so, my dear Cyrus?'
"I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few days I shall learn more on this point."
Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of the volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the echoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping soundly.
Three days passed by--the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction of the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy. Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would only look at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,--
"Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer."
In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and it did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure, had yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on the northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain.
Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other duties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the island. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where the flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the provision of forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as he was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton--
"As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you."
"But, Captain Harding," exclaimed the sailor, "our working days will not be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!"
"We shall return to-morrow," replied Cyrus Harding, "but it is necessary that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is progressing."
"The eruption! always the eruption!" answered Pencroft, with an air of discontent. "An important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself very little about it."
Whatever might be the sailor's opinion, the expedition projected by the engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.
The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.
Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled heavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances. It was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange opacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered pumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were held in suspension in the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so fine that they have been observed in the air for whole months. After the eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was thus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were only with difficulty discernible.
But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the present occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the corral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly changed the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately, the wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud dissolved itself over the sea.
"This is very singular, Captain Harding," said Ayrton.
"It is very serious," replied the engineer. "This powdered pumice-stone, all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward in the lower depths of the volcano."
"But can nothing be done?"
"Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you, therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red Creek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern aspect. Then--"
"Well, Captain Harding?"
"Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any rate I will come back for you in two hours."
Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the engineer's return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which seemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of an eruption.
Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed Red Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had discovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration.
How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he counted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by some piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected in this part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors. Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn, and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.
The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the northern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft.
"But I would prefer that it were so," said Cyrus Harding to himself. "At any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed track. who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger does not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the danger does not lie there!"
Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on this side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his mind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch.
He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder, interrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached the corral.
Ayrton awaited him.
"The animals are cared for, Captain Harding," said Ayrton.
"Good, Ayrton."
"They seem uneasy, Captain Harding."
"Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived."
"Are you ready?"
"Take a lamp, Ayrton," answered the engineer; "we will start at once."
Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral. The gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding Ayrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore.
The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen from the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had fled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the two colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each other. They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.
It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments, to make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the oxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration. At every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was therefore past ten o'clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island.
Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity, following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure.
The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon reached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped towards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no beach could he seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat upon the basaltic rocks.
Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.
"The iron boat should be there," said the engineer.
"It is here, Captain Harding," replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.
"On board, Ayrton!"
The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there Ayrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took the oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered through the shades of the grotto.
The "Nautilus" was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of Captain Nemo.
The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled the engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.
"That comes from the volcano," he said.
Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.
"This is what Captain Nemo feared," murmured Cyrus Harding, changing countenance. "We must go to the end, notwithstanding."
"Forward!" replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat towards the head of the cavern.
Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat reached the extreme end.
Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a hundred feet--it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness.
The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed the basaltic wall at a greater elevation.
There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken by large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of the water's edge.
Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,--
"Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible danger!"
Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of Dakkar Grotto.
天亮的时候，居民们默默地回到洞窟的出口，为了纪念尼摩船长，他们把这里叫做达卡洞。现在正是落潮的时候，他们毫不困难地从拱形洞口下边穿过去，海水从右边冲刷着船身。
他们把小船小心地保存在这里，使它不受海水的冲击。为了防备万一起见，潘克洛夫、纳布和艾尔通又把船拉回洞内，放在洞壁一边的沙滩上，在这里是不会受到任何损伤的。
暴风雨在夜里就已经停息了。最后几声低沉的雷响在西方渐渐地平静下来。虽然雨已经不下了，天空却还满布着阴云。十月份是南半球春天的第一个月，总的来说，这个月的天气看不出有好转的朕兆。风向正在从一个罗盘方位转向另一个方位，这就不用指望有明朗的天气了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们离开了达卡洞，径直前往畜栏。纳布和赫伯特一路小心地把船长从畜栏拉到洞窟的电线收起来，以后也许会有用的。
居民们一路上很少说话。10月15日夜里发生的种种事情给他们留下了深刻的印象。尼摩船长——那个及时帮助他们的陌生人，那个他们想象中具有超凡力量的人，已经离开人间一去不复返了。他和他的诺第留斯号已经埋葬在深渊里。居民们人人都觉得比以前更加孤单了。他们过去常常期待的那种救助的力量巳经不存在了；连吉丁•史佩莱，甚至是赛勒斯•史密斯也免不了产生这种感觉。因此他们往畜栏走的时候一句话也没有说。
早上将近九点钟的时候，居民们回到了“花岗石宫”。
大家原来就有过决定，要积极加快进行造船工作。这回赛勒斯•史密斯更是投入了全部时间和力量，以求达到这个目的。未来的一切是没法预料的。如果有一只坚固的船，如果这只船在坏天气航海也不怕，在需要作相当长时期的航行的时候也不嫌小的话，肯定地说，对于移民们是有很大好处的。船造好以后，居民们即使不打算马上离开林肯岛，到太平洋玻里尼西亚群岛的任何一个小岛或新西兰的海岸，至少也要尽快地到达抱岛去，把关于艾尔通的通知留在那里。这项准备工作是必要的，因为苏格兰游船可能要重新到这一带海洋上来。在这一点上丝毫不能马虎，这是十分重要的。
于是工作重新开始了。赛勒斯•史密斯、潘克洛夫和艾尔通在纳布、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特的帮助下，不停地进行着工作，除非有其他的必要事情，才不得已暂时停止。值得注意的是，一旦刮起秋分的暴风，就没法航海了。他们要想在刮风以前到达抱岛去，就必须在三月初把船造好，也就是说，五个月内新船就得完工。于是木匠们一刻空余时间也不放过。飞快号上的索具全部都保留了下来，他们不需要制造索具，只要制造船身就行了。
1868年年底的时候，他们进行着这项重要工作，其他几乎什么都不干。两个半月以后，肋材摆正了，第一批铺板也放妥了。这时候已经看得出赛勒斯•史密斯的设计巧妙，船在海里一定可以航行得很好。
潘克洛夫工作得非常积极，甚至伙伴们放下斧头，拿起枪去打猎，他也要发牢骚。但是为了迎接冬天，“花岗石宫”里是必须保持相当数量的储备物资的。这么一来却引起了潘克洛夫的不高兴。工人们一离开造船所，勇敢而忠实的水手就会感到不满意。每当发生这种情况的时候，他就非常不满，他赌起气来，一个人干六个人的活。
整个的夏天，天气都不能令人满意。有几天热得吃不消，大气里充满了雷电，经过一阵狂风暴雨，才爽朗一些。难得有几天听不见远处的雷鸣，隆隆的雷声不断地响着，这正是地球上赤道地区的特色。
1869年1月1日发生了空前未有的暴风雨。荒岛上几次响起了霹雳声。闪电击倒了许多大树。湖的南岸有许多高大的榆树覆盖着家禽场，其中有一棵也被劈倒了。这种大气现象和地心的变化有没有关系呢？大气的振荡和地底的变动有没有牵连呢？赛勒斯•史密斯认为是有关系的，因为随着暴风雨的发作，火山复活的朕兆也显露出来了。
1月3日天刚亮的时候，赫伯特拿着缰绳打算给一头野驴套上，他爬上眺望岗的高地以后，发现火山顶上冒起了一大股象帽子似的烟雾。
赫伯特立刻告诉居民们，大家听了以后，马上和他一起出来观察富兰克林山的山顶。
“啊！”潘克洛夫大声说，“这一次不是水汽了！看样子这个大家伙不只是要喘气，它还要冒烟！”
水手的这个比喻恰好表达了火山口发生的变化。三个月来，火山口一直喷着水汽，虽然水汽有时候浓，有时候淡，但始终只是由于内部矿物质沸腾而引起的。然而现在却不是水汽了，代替水汽的是一股浓烟，它象一根灰色的柱子，底部宽达三百多英尺，上升到离山顶七八百英尺的高空，然后四面散开，象一个极大的蘑菇。
“喷烟口里有火了。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“这火我们没法扑灭！”赫伯特说。
“应该把火山去掉。”纳布一本正经地说。
“说得好，纳布！”潘克洛夫大声笑道，“那么，这项工作一定由你来负责了？”
赛勒斯•史密斯离开伙伴，向前走了几步，注视着富兰克林山里冒出来的浓烟。他还倾听了一会儿，似乎认为远处应该有隆隆的响声。然后，他又回到伙伴们跟前来，说：
“不错，朋友们，我们不能欺骗自己，现在要发生重大的变故了。火山内部现在不只是在沸腾，而是已经着了火，毫无疑问，我们将要受到火山爆发的威胁了。”
“那么，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫说，“我们就等着看它爆发吧。要是爆发得好，我们就鼓掌。我认为我们根本不必为这件事情进一步操心。”
“也可能象你说的那样，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“因为古代的岩浆出口现在还开着。正因为这样，所以过去岩浆喷发出来，一直向北边流。可是……”
“可是既然火山爆发对我们没有什么好处，最好还是不要爆发。”通讯记者说。
“那谁知道？”水手说。“也许这个火山里有什么宝贵的东西，要是把它喷出来，我们还可以利用呢！”
赛勒斯•史密斯摇摇头，好象预料这个突如其来的现象不会有好结果似的。他没有象潘克洛夫那样，把爆发的后果看得那么轻松。就算由于火山口的位置的缘故，岩浆不直接威胁岛上的森林和已经开拓的地带，但是爆发以后还是会引起其他“并发症”的。事实上，火山爆发往往会附带发生地震。林肯岛又是一个由不同地质形成的岛屿，有的地方是玄武岩，有的地方是花岗岩，北边是凝结的熔岩，南边是肥沃的土壤；这些物质不可能结合得很紧密，因此很有崩裂的危险。因为这个缘故，虽然熔浆四溢不一定会造成严重的灾祸，但是如果由于大地结构的动摇而使整个的荒岛解体，却会造成不堪设想的后果。
艾尔通趴在地上，把耳朵贴在地面听了一会儿，然后说，“我好象听见一种低沉的隆隆声，就象一辆拉着铁条的马车发出的声音。”
居民们聚精会神地听了一会儿，证明艾尔通并没有听错。在隆隆的响声里，还夹杂着一种地下的轰鸣，形成一种“渐强”的节奏；然后又慢慢地消失下去，好象地底下来了一阵狂风暴雨，逐渐又过去了似的。但是他们却听不到一般所说的爆炸声。由此，可以下这样的结论：水汽和浓烟可以从中央管道里自由地放出去，安全活门相当宽大，不致产生激变，因此也不必担心爆炸。
“好了！”潘克洛夫说，“我们还不回去工作吗？让富兰克林山去尽情地冒烟、轰鸣、吼叫和喷火吧，我们没有理由停工站在这里！来吧，艾尔通、纳布、赫伯特、史密斯先生、史佩莱先生，今天大家都得参加工作！我们现在要去装内龙骨了，十二条胳膊也不嫌多。新船造好以后，我们还用老名字乘风破浪号叫它，好不好？我计划在两个月以内，让我们的新乘风破浪号在气球港上漂浮！所以，一个钟头也不能浪费！”
在潘克洛夫的号召下，居民们全都走向造船所去安装内龙骨了。内龙骨是很厚的木料，它构成船的下部，把船身的肋材牢牢地结合在一起。人人都参加了这项艰巨的工作。
这一天是1月3日，他们整天在工作，没有进一步考虑火山的问题；再说，从“花岗石宫”下面的海滩上也看不见富兰克林山。但是，虽然这一天天气十分晴朗，太阳在运转的过程中，却有一两次被巨大的阴影遮住了，这说明有一股浓烟从太阳和林肯岛之间经过。岸上的风把这些水汽都刮到西边去了。赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱注意到这几次天空阴暗的情况。火山复活的现象肯定在进一步发展着；他们时时讨论这个问题，但是工作并没有停顿。不论从哪方面来看，都应该尽快把船造好，这是最重要的前提。万一发生了变故，居民们只要有船，就有了非常可靠的保障。也许这只船将来会成为他们唯一的避难所，这又有谁知道呢？
晚饭以后，赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱和赫伯特又爬上了眺望岗的高地。这时候天已经黑了。由于周围是昏暗的，他们可以看得出来，火山口上升的水汽和烟雾里是不是夹带着火焰或火山里喷出来的白热物体。
“山口着火了！”赫伯特比他的伙伴敏捷一些，他首先跑到高地上。
富兰克林山离他们大约有六英里。这时候，它象一个巨大的火把，顶端缭绕着一团烟火。山顶上浓烟密布，里面夹杂的大概是岩烬和熔渣，因此在苍茫的暮色中，火光显得很微弱。但是整个的荒岛上却笼罩着一片黯淡的红光，在红光映照中屹立着高岗上朦胧的树影。水汽象旋风似的升上去散成一大片，把天空遮满了，只能隐隐约约地看见几颗星星在闪烁。
“变得太快了！”工程师说。
“这并不稀奇，”通讯记者说。“火山已经复活很久了。你大概还记得，赛勒斯，我们第一次冒见水汽是在满山寻找尼摩船长的住处的时候。假如我没有记错的话，那是在10月15日前后。”
“是的，”赫伯特说，“那是在两个半月以前！”
“因此，地下火已经燃烧了十个星期了，”吉丁•史佩莱接着说，“现在它们发展到这个程度那是没有什么值得大惊小怪的！”
“你觉得地面有些运动吗？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道。
“我感觉到一些了，”吉丁•史佩莱回答说，“可是这离地震还差得很远呢。”
“我并没有说我们已经遭到地震的威胁了，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“但愿上帝保佑我们不要遭到地震！现在不是地震，这个震动是因为地心的火焰达到高热的缘故。地壳其实就好比锅炉的锅身，要知道，在蒸汽的压力下，锅身就会和响亮的金属片似的颤动起来。现在出现的就是这种现象。”
“多么美丽的火焰啊！”赫伯特叫道。
这时候一串火花从火山口里直喷出来，虽然蒙着一层水汽，还是可以看得出火花的亮光。弯弯曲曲的火舌头和上万的火星向四面八方飞开。有的驱散了浓烟，留下一道白热的粉末，一直飞出烟雾的范围以外，同时还发出一连串的爆炸，象一排机关枪在发射似的。
赛勒斯•史密斯、通讯记者和赫伯特在眺望岗的高地上逗留了一个钟头，然后走下海滩，又回“花岗石宫”去了。工程师全神贯注地想着心事。他想得出神，吉丁•史佩莱止不住问他是不是担心火山爆发目前就会直接或间接地发生危险。
“也可以说是的，也可以说不是的。”赛勒斯•史密斯答道。
“不过，”通讯记者说，“我们所能遇到的最大的不幸，不就是能使荒岛崩毁的地震吗？我认为这倒不必害怕，因为出口畅通，水汽和岩浆能够喷得出去。”
“不错，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我倒并不害怕一般由于地下气体膨胀而引起地面震撼的地震。怕的是还有别的原因会引起严重的后果。”
“什么原因呢，亲爱的赛勒斯？”
“我也不能肯定，需要考虑考虑。过几天我到山里去看一看，就可以知道得更多一些了。”
吉丁•史佩莱不开口了。虽然火山在爆炸，而且爆炸得愈来愈猛烈，虽然爆炸的回声传遍荒岛，但是不大的工夫，“花岗石宫”的居民们就进入梦乡了。
1月4日、5日、6日，三天过去了。造船的工作辛勤地继续着。工程师没有进一步说明什么，只是投入全副精力来加紧工作。这时候富兰克林山上覆盖着一片阴暗而险恶的烟雾，烈焰里喷出一些白热的岩石，有的喷出来以后，又掉到火山口里去了。老拿这件事开玩笑的潘克洛夫瞧见以后，不禁喊道：
“啊，这个大家伙在耍剑球啦！它是一个魔术家。”
喷出来的物质又掉进深渊去了。从这一点来看，虽然内部的压力已经使岩浆上涨起来，似乎还没有升到齐火山口那么高。面向东北的缺口有一部分是可以望得见的，至少它还没有向北部山坡流岩浆。
造船的任务十分紧急，但是荒岛各处其他的工作移民们也不能不做。首先他们必须到畜栏去，因为摩弗仑羊和山羊都圈养在那里，必须给它们补充饲料。大家决定让艾尔通第二天——1月7日——到那里去。畜栏里的工作他是熟悉的，并且他一个人也忙得过来，可是这时候潘克洛夫和其他的人却意外地听见工程师对艾尔通说：
“既然你要到畜栏去，我陪你一起去吧。”
“可是，史密斯先生，”水手叫道，“我们的工作期限很近了，你再一走，我们就少两个人了！”
“我们明天就回来，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我是非到畜栏去不可的。我要了解一下火山爆发得怎么样了。”
“火山爆发！老是火山爆发！”潘克洛夫带着不满意的表情说。“不错，火山爆发是一件大事！可是我就不在乎。”
不管水手有什么意见，工程师预定第二天到畜栏去的事情还是决定了。赫伯特要跟赛勒斯•史密斯一起去，但是工程师不愿意引起潘克洛夫更大的不高兴，就作罢了。
第二天天一亮，赛勒斯•史密斯和艾尔通就跳上了两匹野驴拉的大车，飞快地奔向畜栏去了。
大片的烟雾从森林上飘过，富兰克林山的火山口不断往烟里添加烟垢。这些弥漫在空中的浓烟显然包含着各种杂质。它们那种奇怪的不透明的颜色和重量，并不是单纯从火山里得来的。在这些浓烟里，还悬浮着浮石粉似的尘状岩烬以及和最细微的淀粉粒一样的灰色尘埃。这些尘埃非常轻微，往往能在空中飘荡好几个月。1783年冰岛的火山爆发以后，一年多之内大气里还弥漫着火山的灰烬，连太阳光都不容易透过来。
但是，这种粉状的物质还是下降的时候多。现在就是这种情形。赛勒斯•史密斯和艾尔通快到畜栏的时候，天空忽然下了一阵象细火药面似的“黑雪”，地面上立刻变了样。树木、草场都不见了，上面盖着一层几寸厚的烟灰。幸亏这时候刮着东北风，浓烟大部分都被驱到海上去了。
“真奇怪，史密斯先生。”艾尔通说。
“情况很严重，”工程师说。“这种浮石粉和所有这些矿物质的灰尘说明火山底层正在发生着重大的激变。”
“没有办法可想吗？”
“除了观察情况发展以外，没有其他的办法。因此，艾尔通，你在畜栏里照常做你的工作，我要上红河发源地那边去一趟，观察一下北山坡的情况。然后……”
“然后怎么样，史密斯先生？”
“然后我们就去探索达卡洞。我要去看看那里的情况。总之，两个钟头之内我一定回来。”
于是艾尔通就到畜栏里去了。他一面等工程师，一面忙着照料摩弗仑羊和山羊。羊群在火山爆发最初的朕兆之下，都感到有些不安。
这时候赛勒斯•史密斯爬上东部支脉的顶峰，经过红河，来到他们第一次旅行时发现硫磺泉的地点。
事情变得多厉害啊！现在他看见的烟不是一股，而是十三股。这些烟往外播送，好象地底下有活塞在猛烈推动似的。地球的这部分地壳显然遭到了惊人的压力。大气里充满了各种气体，还有和水蒸气混合在一起的碳酸气。这一带平地上所铺的火山凝灰岩，是长期以来由岩烬的粉末凝结而成的硬石块。赛勒斯•史密斯觉得脚下的凝灰岩在颤动，但是他并没有发现新的岩浆。
工程师把富兰克林山的整个北山坡全看过以后，没有岩浆这一点是更加肯定了。火山口里冲出许多火柱和烟柱。一阵岩烬象雹子似的降落在地上。但是岩浆并没有涌出火山口，这说明火山物质还没有上涨到中央管口的最上方。
“可是我宁可让岩浆漫出来，”赛勒斯•史密斯自言自语地说。“那样至少就可以知道岩浆是在从老路往外流了。要不然谁敢说它们不会另开一条新路呢？但是危险并不在那儿！尼摩船长事先已经看清这一点了！不，危险不在那儿！”
赛勒斯•史密斯向广阔的堤道走去，堤道延长下去的地方是鲨鱼湾的外围。现在他可以在这边仔细观察古代岩浆流经的路径。他完全可以肯定，最近一次火山爆发已喷是很久以前的事了。
然后，他又从原路回去。一路上他仔细倾听地下的隆隆声，偶尔有几下震耳的爆炸打断这种经久不停的沉雷声。早上九点钟，他回到了畜栏。
艾尔通正在等他。
“牲口已经照料妥了，史密斯先生。”艾尔通说。
“好，艾尔通。”
“它们好象很不安稳，史密斯先生。”
“是的，这是直觉向它们报警，直觉是决不会欺骗它们的。”
“你准备好了吗？”
“带一盏灯，艾尔通，”工程师说，“我们马上就走。”
艾尔通照他的话做了。他们卸下野驴的缰绳，让它们在畜栏里游荡。赛勒斯•史密斯带领着艾尔通，从外面关了门，然后走上通往西岸的羊肠小道。
他们走过的土地布满了浓烟里掉下来的尘埃。森林里没有野兽，甚至连鸟类也飞走了。有时候微风扬起铺在地上的烟灰，把他们包围在尘土的漩涡里，彼此互相都看不见。为了免得被烟灰迷了眼睛和呛住嗓子，他们小心地用手帕捂住两眼和口腔。
有了这种障碍，赛勒斯•史密斯和艾尔通是不可能走得很快的。再加上空气闷塞，似乎已经燃烧去一部分氧气，不适合呼吸了。每走一百步，他们就不得不停下来喘息一会儿。因此，等工程师和他的伙伴来到由庞大的玄武岩和斑岩形成的荒岛西北岸山石顶峰的时候，已经是十点多钟了。
艾尔通和赛勒斯•史密斯开始往陡坡下面走去。他们几乎每一步都按照那个狂风暴雨的夜晚所走的通向达卡洞的险路。这次是大白天，下坡不象上次那么危险；并且冲刷过的岩石上还铺了一层烟尘，因此脚步要稳得多。
他们很快就来到了海岸尽头高约四十英尺的分水线。赛勒斯•史密斯记得这道高耸的分水线是逐渐倾斜到海面去的。虽然这时候潮水很低，但是还看不见海滩。冲击着玄武岩石块的波涛非常混浊，那是由于掺杂了火山烟垢的缘故。
赛勒斯•史密斯和艾尔通顺利地找到了达卡洞的入口。他们在洞口前的最后一块岩石旁边停留了一会。
“铁皮小船应该是在那一面。”工程师说。
“在这儿呢，史密斯先生。”艾尔通一面说，一面把保存在拱门底下的轻便小船拉过来。
“上船，艾尔通！”
他们跨上小船。微微起伏的波浪把它送到洞窟的很低的拱门底下。艾尔通在这里用火刀火石点着了灯，他把灯放在船头，使灯光往前照，然后拿起桨来。赛勒斯•史密斯掌着舵，向阴暗的洞窟里驶去。
诺第留斯号不再用它的电光照耀洞窟了。船上的电灯光也许还没有灭，但是却没有一线光亮从尼摩船长长眠的深渊里透到上面来。
灯光虽然微弱，但是还能照引着工程师沿洞窟的石壁慢慢前进。在穹窿底下——至少是在靠外面的这一部分——是死一般的寂静。可是再往里走一会儿，赛勒斯•史密斯就清晰地听到火山内部传来的隆隆声了。
“那是从火山里传来的。”工程师说。
除了这种声音之外，他们很快又闻到一种强烈的气味，一闻到这种味道就知道这里在起着化学变化。这种带有硫磺味的水蒸气几乎使工程师和他的伙伴透不过气来。
“尼摩船长顾虑的就是这个，”赛勒斯•史密斯喃喃地说，他的脸色变了。“不过，我们还是要到洞底去。”
“往前走！”艾尔通一面说，一面弯腰拾起双桨，把小船划向洞窟的尽头。
进洞二十五分钟以后，小船来到了洞窟深处。
这时候赛勒斯•史密斯站起来，把灯光投在石壁上。这一堵石壁隔开了洞窟和火山的中央管道。石壁有多厚呢？也许有十英尺，也许有一百英尺——那没法估计。但是地底下火山的响声太清楚了，估计石壁是不会有多厚的。
工程师察看了石壁的下部以后，又把灯绑在桨上，察看高处的玄武岩石壁。
就在这里，石壁上有许多不容易看清的缝隙，一种刺鼻的水蒸气从缝隙里钻出来，散布在洞窟的空气里。石壁上还有几处很大的裂缝，有的一直往下裂到离水面只有二三英尺的地方。
赛勒斯•史密斯沉吟了一会儿，然后低声说：
“是的！船长说得对！危险就在这里，这个危险太可怕了！”
艾尔通一句话也没有说。赛勒斯•史密斯做了一个手势，他又划起桨来。半个钟头以后，他和工程师又回到达卡洞口来了。
Book 3 Chapter 19
The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed at the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton arrived at Granite House.
The engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed them of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from which no human power could deliver them.
"My friends," he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion, "our island is not among those which will endure while this earth endures. It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of which it bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it."
The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not clearly comprehend him.
"Explain yourself, Cyrus!" said Gideon Spilett.
"I will do so," replied Cyrus Harding, "or rather I will simply afford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private conversation, was given me by Captain Nemo."
"Captain Nemo!" exclaimed the colonists.
"Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death!"
"The last service!" exclaimed Pencroft, "the last service! You will see that though he is dead he will render us others yet!"
"But what did the captain say?" inquired the reporter.
"I will tell you, my friends," said the engineer. "Lincoln Island does not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which Captain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the subversion of its foundation."
"Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can't be!" cried Pencroft, who, in spite of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of incredulity.
"Listen, Pencroft," resumed the engineer, "I will tell you what Captain Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.
"This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is only separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it. Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape."
"Well?" said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.
"Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that after a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters of the lake which fill the cavern."
"Good!" replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. "The sea will extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!"
"Not so!" said Cyrus Harding, "should a day arrive when the sea, rushing through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day be blown into the air--just as would happen to the island of Sicily were the Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna."
The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer. They now understood the danger by which they were menaced.
It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger to be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be possible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on the shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of the water. But they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk of blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is suddenly expanded by intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity whose temperature might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would be converted into steam with a sudden energy which no enclosure could resist.
It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful and approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall of Dakkar Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a question of months, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of hours.
The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow. They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves personally, but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered them, which they had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped to render so flourishing. So much effort ineffectually expended, so much labor lost.
Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor did he attempt to conceal it.
Some further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of the colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was not an hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel should be pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the sole chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island.
All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail to sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House? The contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than sufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its duration. But it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive them before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive.
Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of January the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no change had taken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with flames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater. But during the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the level of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which formed over the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out of Granite House.
This occurred about two o'clock in the morning.
The sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand feet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had been thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation. Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the plain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea. The aperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a glare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere appeared red-hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the new summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase too full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the volcano.
"The corral! the corral!" exclaimed Ayrton.
It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the new crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the island, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with instant destruction.
At Ayrton's cry the colonists rushed to the onagers' stables. The cart was at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought--to hasten to the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.
Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them. Already a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from the side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the palisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered with terror, fled in all directions.
An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into vapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up the house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to mark the spot where the corral once stood.
To contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness. In presence of Nature's grand convulsions man is powerless.
It was now daylight--the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his companions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take. The soil sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach the plateau of Prospect Heights.
"The lake will cover us," said Gideon Spilett.
"I hope so!" was Cyrus Harding's only reply.
The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their progress. It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and on the other that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its passage. There was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava; on the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The volcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it was by a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater. From two openings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth, thus forming two distinct streams. Above the new crater a cloud of smoke and ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed over the island. Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet, burst in the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano's eruption.
Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the corral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly transformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while others, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.
The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination of the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves became solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately.
Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and more menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fare, and enormous wreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whore trunks were already consumed by the lava.
The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of Red Creek. A question of life or death was now to be decided.
Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever it might be, then said,--
"Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of the island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will remain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no prospect but that of starvation upon these barren rocks--a death which will probably be anticipated by the explosion of the island."
"In that case," replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his foot, "what's the use of working any longer on the vessel?"
"Pencroft," answered Cyrus Harding, "we must do our duty to the last!"
At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the lake. At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it been greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent.
"To work!" cried Cyrus Harding.
The engineer's thought was at once understood. it might be possible to dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the lake.
The colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels, picks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen trees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet high and some hundreds of paces in length. It seemed to them, when they had finished, as if they had scarcely been working more than a few minutes.
It was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after reached the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West. But the dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet.
The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded this strife of the two elements.
What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen could describe the marvelous horror of this scene--what pencil could depict it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling lava. The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, however considerable might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must eventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream of lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new waves of incandescent matter.
The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified and accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface fell other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step nearer the center of the lake. In this manner was formed a pier which threatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the water displaced by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water rent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind, fell in rain upon the sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the blocks of lava piled themselves one on another. Where formerly stretched the calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking rocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified by an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake three hours alter the eruption of this irresistible torrent of lava.
This time water would be vanquished by fire.
Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the effusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They had before them some days' respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights, Granite House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these few days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking the vessel, and launching her. The colonists would then take refuge on board the vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the waters. With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the island there could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House, once so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.
During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the colonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as twenty men could have done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment's repose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day. The flow of lava continued, but perhaps less abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely choked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread over the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.
But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not so with the western part.
In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of Falls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the creek being flat, met with no obstacle. The burning liquid had then spread through the forest of the Far West. At this period of the year, when the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire instantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended itself both by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose interlacement favored its progress. It even appeared that the current of flame spread more rapidly among the summits of the trees than the current of lava at their bases.
Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras, koalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks of the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon. But the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any attention to even the most formidable of these animals. They had abandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter at the Chimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.
Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never Pencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now so utterly devastated.
It was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the island was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised their heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there were a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the devastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption of lava had been complete. Where formerly sprang up that charming verdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa. In the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now flowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up, the colonists would have no means of quenching their thirst. But, fortunately the lava had spared the southern corner of the lake, containing all that remained of the drinking water of the island. Towards the northwest stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of the sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island. What a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who, from a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses, and enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it were, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves of provisions, they could not even gather the means of subsistence!
"It is enough to break one's heart!" said Gideon Spilett, one day.
"Yes, Spilett," answered the engineer. "May God grant us the time to complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!"
"Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat lessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less abundantly, if I mistake not."
"It matters little," answered Cyrus Harding. "The fire is still burning in the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment. We are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a conflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or later the flames must reach the powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to work, and let us not lose an hour!"
During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February, the lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the previous limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied matter should overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could not escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of the island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.
It was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the vessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then? The intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel as soon as the hull should be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the interior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the essential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge away from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the vessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event of any convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore concentrated upon the completion of the hull.
Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching the vessel in ten days.
Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth year of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even Pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it is true, were concentrated upon his vessel.
"We shall finish it," he said to the engineer, "we shall finish it, captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox will soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island to spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah, how unfortunate! Who could have believed it possible?"
"Let us get on," was the engineer's invariable reply.
And they worked away without losing a moment.
"Master," asked Neb, a few days later, "do you think all this could have happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?"
"Certainly, Neb," answered Cyrus Harding.
"I, for one, don't believe it!" whispered Pencroft to Neb.
"Nor I!" answered Neb seriously.
During the first week of March appearances again became menacing. Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain upon the island. The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano. The torrent flowed along the surface of the hardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had withstood the first eruption. The stream, flowing this time towards the southwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and invaded the plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of the colonists was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables, were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all directions. Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their instinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of the animals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those which survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even this last retreat was now closed to them, and the lava- torrent, flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of fire. The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description. During the night it could only be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors above and its boiling masses below.
The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch her at once.
Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for the launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the 9th of March.
But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping from the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than three thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way under the pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central shalt into the igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor. But the crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor. An explosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles, shook the air. Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a few minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once stood.
赛勒斯•史密斯和艾尔通在畜栏里逗留了一天一夜，把一切都料理完毕，第二天——1月8日——又回到“花岗石宫”里来了。
工程师立刻召集了全体伙伴，告诉大家，林肯岛的危险就在眼前了，谁也没有办法拯救他们脱离这个险境。
“朋友们，”他的声音显得非常激动，“我们的岛并不是能和地球共存的岛。它早晚要毁灭了，毁灭的原因是潜藏在岛的里面，这是没法挽回的。”
移民们你看着我，我看着你，然后又看看工程师。他们还不大明白他的意思。
“你解释一下吧，赛勒斯！”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“我要解释的，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“换句话说，我要把尼摩船长在和我所作的几分钟单独谈话里告诉我的事情传达给你们。”
“尼摩船长！”居民们叫道。
“是的，这是他在临死以前准备给我们尽的最后一次义务！”
“最后一次义务！”潘克洛夫大声说，“最后一次义务！你们将来会看到，虽然他死了，他还会给我们尽其他义务的！”
“船长究竟说了些什么呢？”通讯记者问道。
“我要告诉你们的，朋友们，”工程师说。“林肯岛和太平洋里的其他岛屿不同，尼摩船长告诉我，它的基础迟早要崩溃的。”
“这是没有的事！林肯岛决不会那样！”潘克洛夫叫道。虽然他很尊敬赛勒斯•史密斯，但是在这一点上，他却不由得耸了一耸肩膀。
“听着，潘克洛夫，”工程师接着说，“我要把尼摩船长告诉我的话讲给你们听。昨天我探索了达卡洞，已经亲自证实了他的话。这个洞窟在荒岛下面一直绵延到火山底下，火山的中央管道和洞窟之间只隔着一层洞底的石壁。这片石壁上有许多裂缝和洞隙，现在火山内部发出来的硫磺气体已经从缝隙里透出来了。”
“怎么？”潘克洛夫突然皱起眉头说。
“后来我发现这些缝隙由于内部压力的影响已经变宽了。玄武岩的石壁逐渐裂开，它早晚会裂成一条大口子，使火山管道与灌满海水的洞窟相沟通的。”
“好哇！”潘克洛夫打趣地说。“让海水把火山淹灭吧，然后就没有事了！”
“完全不是那样！”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“等到海水灌进洞窟，穿过中央管道进入荒岛内部沸腾的岩浆那儿去，那时候林肯岛就要炸到天上去了——要是地中海的海水灌到埃得纳火山里去，西西里岛也会发生这种情形的。”
居民们听了工程师这几句说明事态严重的话之后，都没有回答。他们现在明白自己将要遭到的危险了。
应该附带说明，赛勒斯•史密斯丝毫没有夸大值得担心的危险。火山的位置几乎都是靠海或是傍湖的；许多人都认为只要开一条通道把水灌进去，就可以使火山熄灭了。但是他们却不知道这样会引起地球局部爆炸的危险，正象锅炉里的汽体遇到高热突然膨胀的情形一样。火山内部洞穴里的热度有几千度高，水灌进去以后立刻就会转化为汽体，这样就产生出一种突然的能量，这种能量是任何屏障也阻挡不住的。
因此，即将到来的可怕剧变威胁着荒岛。达卡洞的石壁能保持多长时间，林肯岛也就只能存在多长时间，那是毫无疑义的。这已经不是几个月几个星期的问题，而是几天，甚至可能是几小时之内的问题。
居民们的心情首先是极度的忧伤。他们并没有过多考虑自己将要遇到的危险，他们考虑的是一向依赖它生存的荒岛将要遭到毁灭。他们开拓了这个荒岛，他们热爱这片土地，他们想使它变得无比繁荣。但是，无数的心血都白白消耗了。许多劳动都浪费了。
潘克洛夫忍不住掉下大颗眼泪来，他也不想隐藏他的悲痛。
现在又进一步谈论了其他的情况。移民们研究了还对他们有利的机会。最后大家一致同意一个钟头也不浪费，要拿出全部力量来加速赶造并装配新船，因为这是林肯岛居民唯一能够获得安全的出路。
于是，每个人都参加了造船工作。现在播种、收割、打猎和补充“花岗石宫”的储备物资还有什么用呢？不管要在海上航行多长时间，仓库和外室里现存的物资都足够船上的需要。但是要紧的是：必须把船造好，使它能在不可避免的灾难到来以前供他们使用。
现在他们热烈地进行着工作。l月23日前后，船上的甲板已经铺好一半了。到目前为止，火山顶上还没有发生新的变化。火山口还喷射着水汽、烟火和白热的岩石。但是在23日夜间，岩浆达到了火山第一层的表面，覆盖在另一个火山锥上的帽状火山锥不见了。只听见天崩地裂的一声响，居民们起初以为荒岛炸开了，他们连忙从“花岗石宫”里跑出来。
这时候大约是清晨两点钟。
天空好象火烧似的。上面的火山锥——它是一堆高达一千英尺的岩石，重约亿万斤——被抛到地面上来，震动了荒岛的整个地基。幸而这个火山锥偏向北边，因此落在大海和火山之间的沙石和凝灰岩的平原上了。火山口扩大以后，喷向天空的火焰更加明亮；反射出来的光线照得满天通红。同时，一股岩浆的洪流从新的山顶涌了出来，象一条长长的瀑布直泻下来，又好象花瓶里的水盛得太满，向外面溢出来似的。随着岩浆，有成干的火舌头沿着山坡直往下滚。
“畜栏！畜栏！”艾尔通叫道。
不错，岩浆正是向畜栏流去的。新的火山口面向着东方，因此，岛上的富饶地区、红河的源头和啄木鸟林马上就要遭到毁灭了。
移民们听见艾尔通的叫喊以后，急忙向野驴的厩房跑去。大车马上就套好了。人人都只抱着一个念头，那就是：赶快到畜栏去，把关在那里的牲口放出来。
将近早上三点钟的时候，他们来到了畜栏。受惊的摩弗仑羊和山羊大声尖叫，说明它们的恐惧。已经有一股燃烧的物质和岩浆从山坡上倾泻到牧场上来，一直流到栅栏旁边。艾尔通打开大门，吓慌了的牲畜向四面八方逃去。
一个钟头以后，畜栏里就充满了沸腾的岩浆，它们使横贯畜栏的河水化成一片蒸气，房子象干草似的烧光了。栅栏的木桩一根也没有剩，完全认不出这里曾经有过畜栏。
要和这种灾害进行顽抗，那简直是开玩笑，甚至可以说是发疯。面临着自然界的巨大变动，人们是毫无办法的。
现在天已经亮了，这一天是1月24日。赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们想在回“花岗石宫”以前，弄明白泛滥的岩浆大概要往哪一个方向流。从富兰克林山起，地势逐渐在东海岸倾斜下去，虽然有浓密的啄木鸟林隔着，恐怕岩浆的洪流还是会冲到眺望岗的高地上去的。
“格兰特湖会保护我们的。”吉丁•史佩莱说。
“但愿如此！”赛勒斯•史密斯简单地回答了一句。
居民们想到富兰克林山较高的火山锥所坠落的那片平原上去，但是岩浆把他们拦住了。岩浆顺着红河河谷和瀑布河河谷分两路流下来；流过的地方，把河水都蒸发了。要想跨过岩浆的洪流是不可能的，相反地，居民们只好往后撤退。火山去了顶以后，已经不象原来那样了。上面代替古代火山口的是一片平顶，象桌面似的。南边和东边各有一个喷口，岩浆不断从里面涌出来，清清楚楚地形成两股洪流。新火山口上冒起一片夹带灰垢的烟尘，它们和大气里的密云混合在一起，笼罩了整个的荒岛。连成一片的雷鸣轰响着，很难分清这究竟是雷声还是火山的轰隆声。燃烧的石块从火山口里直射到一千多英尺高的上空，然后象开花弹似的爆炸了。一道道的闪电在和火山互相媲美。
早上将近七点钟的时候，居民们的阵地再也守不住了。于是他们就到啄木鸟林的边缘去藏身。不仅是抛射出来的石块象雨点般地落在他们的周围，甚至沿红河河谷流下来的岩浆也要切断畜栏路了。最近的一排树木着了火。树脂突然被蒸发得响亮地爆裂开来。其他比较干燥的树木，在洪流里还没有炸裂。
居民们又走上了畜栏路。他们走得很慢，时常回头张望。由于地面倾斜，岩浆很快地往东流去，下层的岩浆刚刚凝固，跟着流来的沸腾岩浆马上又淹没了它们。
这时候，红河河谷的主要洪流造成的威胁愈来愈大了。这部分森林整个着了火，大股浓烟在树梢上翻滚着，树干已经被岩浆吞没了。
居民们在离红河河口半英里左右的湖边站下脚来。现在要决定生死存亡的问题了。
赛勒斯•史密斯是惯于考虑重要问题的，同时他也知道，不管问题多么严重，他的伙伴们听了以后，也能经受得住。于是他说：
“现在有两种可能：一种是湖水挡得住岩浆前进，这样荒岛上有一部分就可以保留下来，不致完全覆灭；另一种是洪流漫过整个的远西森林，使地上一草一木都不剩；要是这样，我们就没有别的指望，只好在这些光秃秃的石头上等死，如果荒岛爆炸，也许我们的死期还要提前。”
“既是这样，”潘克洛夫叉着两臂跺着脚说，“还要造什么船呢？”
“潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯•史密斯说，“我们一定要尽到最后的努力！”
这时候岩浆的洪流吞没了一部分美丽的树木，从森林里冲出一条道路，一直来到格兰特湖的边缘。这里有一段高岗，要是它的体积再大一些，就可以挡住洪流前进的道路。
“动手！”赛勒斯•史密斯大声说。
大家立刻领会了工程师的意思。他们是可以拦住洪流，让它注到湖里去的。
居民们急忙向造船所跑去，拿了许多铲子、铁锹和斧头回来。他们利用泥土和倒下来的树木，在几个钟头之内筑成一道三英尺高、几百英尺长的堤防。干到完工的时候，他们觉得似乎前后只不过几分钟。
他们完成得恰好是时候。岩浆不久就流到堤防脚下来了。它象洪水要漫过河岸似的泛滥起来。岩浆的来势凶猛，仿佛想冲倒这道唯一可以阻挡它吞食整个远西森林的障碍。但是堤防很牢固，紧张地相持了一会儿以后，洪流泻入了二十英尺以下的格兰特湖。
居民们屏住了气，一句话也不说，呆呆地看着这场水火之战。
这场水火之间的搏斗是多么壮丽的奇观啊！笔墨怎么能形容出这个惊心动魄的场面呢？沸腾的岩浆流进湖里，使湖水蒸发成水汽，发出咝咝的响声。蒸气在空中盘旋直上，升到极高的地方，好象一个大锅炉的汽门突然被打开似的。但是不管湖里的水有多少，最后它总要干涸的，因为湖水已经没法补充了，而岩浆却夹带着白热的物质源源不断地流到湖里来。
第一股岩浆流进湖里以后立刻就凝固了。它们堆积起来很快就高出水面。新的岩浆又泻到它们的表面上，依次化成岩石，但是岩石离湖中心一步比一步近。这样就堆成了一个突堤，看起来它们逐渐要把湖填满了。湖水倒是泛滥不起来的，因为岩浆侵占了它们的地盘，它们就蒸发成水汽了。到处是一片刺耳的咝咝声。水汽被风吹走以后，象雨点般地掉在海里。突堤愈来愈长，凝结的岩块互相堆积在一起。过去平静的湖面上，现在是一大堆热气腾腾的岩石，好象是上升的土地形成的一片宽广的浅滩。要是在脑子里虚构一幅这样的图画：湖水正在被飓风掀起来的时候突然遇到暴寒而冻结起来，那么就可以大致想象出这股不可阻挡的洪流注入湖内三小时以后的情景了。
这一次，水要被火打败了。
不管怎么样，岩浆朝着格兰特湖的方向倾注下来，对居民们还是有利的。他们又可以多活几天了。眺望岗的高地、“花岗石宫”和造船所，暂时都可以保全下来。现在必须利用这几天工夫进行辅板，仔细填塞船缝，赶快使新船下水。然后居民们就可以到船上去避难，等船下水以后再装索具。要是荒岛因为爆炸而被毁灭，那么在岸上是不可能得到安全的。“花岗石宫”这个石洞虽然一向是安全可靠的藏身之地，现在却随时都可能崩溃。
在以后的六天里，从1月25日到1月30日，居民们在造船工作中，做了相当于二十个人的工作。他们几乎片刻也不休息。火山口喷射出来的火光，使他们日夜都可以工作。岩浆继续在往外流，只是也许流得比以前少。幸亏是这样，因为格兰特湖几乎已经填满了，要是有更多的岩浆流过来，那一定会浸到眺望岗的高地上，然后从那里流到海滩上去的。
但是，虽然荒岛的这一边有一部分被挡住，西边的情形却不是这样。
第二股岩浆的洪流是沿着瀑布河的河谷流过来的，这条河谷非常宽阔，再加上两岸地势平坦，因此洪流没有遇到任何障碍。沸腾的岩浆涌进远西森林。在一年的这个时期，由于气候酷热，树木都烤干了。树木立刻起了火，火势非常猛烈，火焰不仅从这个树干蔓延到那个树干，甚至高处的树枝也成了火的媒介；特别是树枝都交叉在一起，蔓延起来更加迅速。树顶的火势似乎比树根岩浆的洪流前进得更快。
美洲豹、野猪、水豚、“考拉”以及各种飞禽走兽都惊惶地往慈悲河沿岸和通向气球港的大路那边的潦凫沼地逃去。居民们正忙着工作，连最凶猛的野兽也不怕了。他们离开了“花岗石宫”，也不住在“石窟”里，只是在慈悲河口搭一个帐篷，在那里露宿。
赛勒斯•史密斯和吉丁•史佩莱每天都到眺望岗的高地上去。有时候赫伯特跟着他们，但是潘克洛夫从来也不去，他不忍心去看目前岛上彻底遭到摧毁的惨象。
这的确是令人痛心的场面。岛上除了盘蛇半岛的尽头还留下一丛苍翠的树木以外，其余的森林地带一点儿也不剩了。到处都是奇形怪状的树桩，烟火把它们熏得漆黑，上面的树枝也都没有了。这一带劫后的森林甚至比潦凫沼地还要荒凉。岩浆的侵袭可以说是无孔不入。一向生气勃勃的青葱原野现在只剩下一片光秃的火山凝灰岩。瀑布河与慈悲河的河谷里，再没有一滴水流往大海了。要是格兰特湖完全干涸了的话，居民们就会没有水喝，幸亏岩浆保留了南边的一角湖水，这就是岛上全部能喝的淡水了。西北方屹立着轮廓鲜明的嶙峋的火山坡，它象一只巨爪从上面抓住荒岛。多么凄凉而可怕的景象啊！居民们一向住的是肥沃的领地，那里覆盖着森林，有水源灌溉，在辛勤的劳动下，还收获了丰富的物产；现在一下子成了荒凉的山石，他们除了保存的食粮以外，连维持生活的必需品都没有了；这是多么令人痛心的事啊！
“真教人心疼死了！”有一天吉丁•史佩莱说。
“是的，史佩莱，”工程师说。“但愿老天爷给我们时间让我们造成这只船，现在它是我们唯一的避难所了！”
“赛勒斯•史密斯，火山不是已经爆发得不那么猛烈了吗？假如我没有搞错的话，那么火山虽然还在喷岩浆，可喷得比以前少了。”
“那倒没有多大关系，”赛勒斯•史密斯说。“问题是火还在山下面燃烧呢，海水随时会灌进去的。我们就好比船上的一群旅客，船失了火，但是我们没法扑灭，同时又知道火一定会烧到火药库里去的。干吧，史佩莱，干吧，一个钟头也不要浪费！”
又过了八天，在这八天里，也就是说，直到2月7日，岩浆还是在不断泛滥，只是火山爆发还仅限在原来的范围以内。赛勒斯•史密斯十分担心岩浆泛滥到海边来，因为这样造船所就保不住了。此外，这时候居民们感到荒岛的结构颤动起来了，这使他们十分惊慌。
这一天是2月20日，还要过一个月，新船才能落成下水。荒岛能维持到那时候吗？按照潘克洛夫和赛勒斯•史密斯的意思，等船身完工以后，立刻就先让它下水。甲板、干舷、内部的木制品和索具都可以等到将来再补做，主要的是要让移民们在荒岛以外有一个可靠的避难所。也许把船带到气球港去——也就是说，尽量使它远离爆炸中心——要好一些，因为一旦发生剧变，他们的船在小岛和花岗石壁之间的慈悲河口，是有被砸碎的危险的。于是航海家们集中全力，赶做船身。
到了3月3日，他们估计在十天之内，可以使新船下水。
居民们在林肯岛上的第四个年头，经受了无数艰苦的考验。这时候他们心里又产生了希望。潘克洛夫一直为他的领地遭到破坏和毁灭而闷闷不乐，这时候也多少开朗一些了。不错，他的希望是寄托在他的船上的。
“我们要把它造成，”他对工程师说，“我们要把它造成，史密斯先生，并且也正是时候，现在正在过渡到秋天，再往后就要到秋分了。到不得已的时候，我们就把船靠在达抱岛，在那儿过冬。可是把达抱岛和林肯岛比较一下吧。啊，真倒楣！谁想得到会发生这样的事呢？”
“我们继续干吧。”工程师总是这么说。
于是他们抓紧每一分钟的时间，继续工作下去。
“主人，”又过了几天，纳布问道，“要是尼摩船长还活着，你认为这一切也会发生吗？”
“当然会的，纳布。”赛勒斯•史密斯说。
“拿我来说吧，我就不这样想！”潘克洛夫凑着纳布耳边说。
“我也有这个看法！”纳布一本正经地说。
三月份的第一个星期，情况又变得险恶了。上万条玻璃丝似的岩浆，雨点般地落在荒岛上。火山口的岩浆又沸腾起来，流遍山脊一带。洪流沿着凝固了的凝灰岩表面流去，把第一次火山爆发以后残存下来的几棵干枯的树干都摧毁了。这一次洪流向格兰特湖的西南岸没过来，一直流过甘油河，侵入眺望岗的高地。它给移民们的事业的最后一次打击是相当可怕的。磨坊、内院的建筑物和厩房都毁坏了。受惊的家禽向四面八方逃去。托普和杰普露出十分害怕的样子，似乎直觉已经告诉它们，大祸就要临头了。在第一次火山爆发的时候，荒岛上已经死了许多野兽。剩下来一些没有死的找不到别的地方安身，全躲在潦凫沼地上，只有少数的野兽逃到眺望岗的高地上来，把这里当作它们的收容所。但是，现在连最后的收容所也不允许它们避难了。岩浆的洪流顺着花岗石壁的边缘，往海滩倾泻下来，形成一道火光闪闪的瀑布。这一幕惊心动魄的场面是没法形容的。在夜里，只能把它比做岩浆的尼亚加拉大瀑布，它的上面是白热的水蒸气，下面是沸腾的物质。
居民们被驱逐到最后的堡垒里去了。虽然新船的上部缝隙还没有填好，他们还是决定让它立刻下水。
他们决定在第二天——3月9日——早上就让新船下水。潘克洛夫和艾尔通做好了必要的准备。
但是，在3月8日的夜晚，一股水蒸汽从火山口里喷出来，一直升到三千英尺以上的高空，就象一根极大的柱子似的，同时还发出惊天动地的爆炸声。显然发生了这样的情形：达卡洞的石壁受到气体的压力而崩裂了，海水穿过中央管道灌进火坑，立刻蒸发成水汽，但是火山口不能够把全部蒸汽排出来，于是发生了一次激荡空气的大爆炸。这次爆炸的声音，就是在一百英里以外也能听见。山岩的碎片飞进太平洋，几分钟以后，海水就漫过林肯岛原先所在的地方了。
Book 3 Chapter 20
An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten from the water's edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of the Pacific had not engulfed.
It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point. All around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf, the plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could now be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge to the six colonists and their dog Top.
The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well as those representing the fauna of the island--all either crushed or drowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in some crevice of the soil.
If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton had survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side.
When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a cable's length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which they found footing.
On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions taken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a little fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the rock, was all that the unfortunate colonists possessed. Their last hope, the vessel, had been shattered to pieces. They had no means of quitting the reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it. It seemed that they must inevitably perish.
This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two days, although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life. All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in their present position. They were in the hand of God.
Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a prey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not for a moment quit the engineer's side, as if demanding from him that assistance he had no power to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to their fate.
"Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!" often repeated Pencroft. "If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have nothing, nothing!"
"Captain Nemo did right to die," said Neb.
During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating only what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their weakness was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium.
Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the shadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a vessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well from experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific. Could they calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the Scotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton at Tabor Island? It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing she should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing out Ayrton's change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having explored Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and return to lower latitudes.
No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death, death from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.
Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer conscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort, from time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the desert ocean.
But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton's arms were extended toward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees, then upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal.
A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an object. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line, under all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out some hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon.
"The 'Duncan'!" murmured Ayrton--and fell back without sign of life.
When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to the attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.
A word from Ayrton explained everything.
"The 'Duncan'!" he murmured.
"The 'Duncan'!" exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to Heaven, he said, "Oh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!"
It was, in fact, the "Duncan," Lord Glenarvan's yacht, now commanded by Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to find Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land alter twelve years of expiation.
The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their native country.
"Captain Grant," asked Cyrus Harding, "who can have suggested to you the idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of coming a hundred miles farther northeast?"
"Captain Harding," replied Robert Grant, "it was in order to find, not only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions."
"My companions and myself?"
"Doubtless, at Lincoln Island."
"At Lincoln Island!" exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.
"How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?" inquired Cyrus Harding, "it is not even named in the charts."
"I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island," answered Robert Grant.
"A document!" cried Gideon Spilett.
"Without doubt, and here it is," answered Robert Grant, producing a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, "the present residence of Ayrton and five American colonists."
"It is Captain Nemo!" cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice, and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper found at the corral.
"Ah!" said Pencroft, "it was then he who took our 'Bonadventure' and hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!"
"In order to leave this notice," added Herbert.
"I was then right in saying," exclaimed the sailor, "that even after his death the captain would render us a last service."
"My friends," said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion, "may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our benefactor."
The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding, and murmured the name of Captain Nemo.
Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, "Where should this coffer be deposited?"
It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now faithfully handed to the engineer.
"Ayrton! Ayrton!" said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing Robert Grant, "Sir," he added, "you left behind you a criminal; you find in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I am proud to clasp in mine."
Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken of what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the charts of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail.
A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their country once more at peace alter the terrible conflict in which right and justice had triumphed.
Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the name of the castaways restored to their country by the "Duncan."
There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say, to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the hospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a vast colony to which they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the Pacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests became the forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on terra firma.
There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions, everything prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island was absent, for they had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his master; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed his studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon Spilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal in the world.
There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister of Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who had taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.
There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had been in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which they had arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four years had supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain Nemo.
The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne 1874
一块孤立的岩石，三十英尺长，二十英尺宽，高出水面几乎还不到十英尺——这是唯一没被太平洋海水淹没的土地。
“花岗石宫”的废墟全在这里了！高大的石壁崩塌下来，砸成碎块，几块较大的岩石堆砌起来，形成这块陆地。被炸成两爿的富兰克林山的较低火山锥、鲨鱼湾的熔岩峡口、眺望岗的高地、安全岛、气球港的花岗石块、达卡洞的玄武岩，甚至连远离爆炸中心的又狭又长的盘蛇半岛也包括在内；所有周围的一切都消失在海洋深处了。林肯岛只剩下这条长方形的岩石，它现在成了六个居民加上托普的避难所。
牲畜都在这场灾难里死去了。鸟类和岛上的几种典型动物有的压死，有的淹死；令人叹息的是，不幸的杰普也被活活压死在地底下了！
赛勒斯•史密斯、吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、纳布和艾尔通这几个人并没有死，原来当时他们聚集在帐篷底下，在荒岛被炸得粉碎，然后象雨点般向四面八方落下来的时候，他们被抛到海里去了。
当他们浮到水面上来的时候，只看见半锚链以外有这么一堆石头，于是他们就游过来，在上面站住了脚。
他们在这堆光石头上巳经活了九天了。不幸的居民们只剩下在遭难以前从“花岗石宫”的仓库里带出来的一些粮食，再有就是岩石低洼处的一些雨水。他们最后的希望——新船——也已被砸得粉碎。他们没法离开这堆礁石：既没有火，也没有取火的方法。看样子他们是非死不可了。
虽然他们尽量节省粮食，每天所吃的只够勉强对付着活下来，但是到3月18日，到底只剩了两天的余粮。在这种情况下，他们全部的科学知识和智慧都没有用处了，只有上帝在掌握着他们的命运。
赛勒斯•史密斯还是那么沉着，吉丁•史佩莱就比较急躁不安了，潘克洛夫则憋着一肚子气，在礁石上走来走去。赫伯特一刻也不离开工程师，望着他，好象在向他求援（但是他也没有办法！）；纳布和艾尔通更是只好听天由命。
“唉，真倒楣！真倒楣！”潘克洛夫不住嘴地说。“要是能有一个核桃壳把我们载到达抱岛去也就好了！但是我们什么也没有，什么也没有！”
“尼摩船长死得倒是时候。”纳布说。
在这以后的五天里，赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们非常小心地节约他们的粮食，他们吃些东西只能使他们不至于饿死。他们的身体都十分软弱。赫伯特和纳布已经显出精神错乱的症状来了。
在这种情况下，他们还能保持一线希望吗？不能！他们还有什么机会呢？盼望有船进到礁石的视线范围里来吗？根据已往的经验，他们了解得很清楚，船只是从来不到太平洋的这一部分来的。要是恰好在这时候，苏格兰游船到达抱岛去找艾尔通，那可真是天意；他们能指望这一点吗？这简直是不可能的。再说，居民们并没把通知送到达抱岛说明艾尔通换了地址；因此，即使邓肯号真的到过那里，船长搜遍全岛也找不到，那时候他们准会回到纬度较低的地区去的。
不！不可能有得救的希望了。他们只能在这堆岩石上等待着可怕的死亡，等待着饥渴来结束他们的生命。
他们躺在礁石上只剩一口气了。周围发生什么事，他们也不知道。只有艾尔通有时候还用尽全身的力量抬起头来，绝望地看看寂寞无人的海洋。
3月24日清晨，艾尔通突然向水平线上的一个黑点伸出手来。他撑起身子，先跪在地上，然后站起来，好象在用手发信号。
礁石附近来了一只船。它显然不是漫无目标的。在蒸汽的推动下，它开足马力，直对着礁石驶来。其实，要是移民们有足够的精力视察水平线的话，几个钟头以前他们就可以看见它了。
“邓肯号！”艾尔通喃喃地说了一声，随后他就不省人事地倒在石头上了。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们经过细心的照料，苏醒过来了。他们醒来以后，发现自己在一只游船的船仓里，也不知道是怎会从死里逃生的。
艾尔通的一句话把一切都说明了。
“邓肯号！”他喃喃地说。
“邓肯号！”赛勒斯•史密斯喊了起来。他举起手来说，“啊！全能的上帝！您发了慈悲，把我们保全下来了！”
不错，这正是邓肯号，格里那凡爵士的游船。艾尔通在达抱岛赎罪已经满十二年了，现在格兰特船长的儿子罗伯尔指挥着邓肯号，奉命来接他回国。
居民们不仅被救活了，而且正在回国的途中。
“格兰特船长，”赛勒斯•史密斯问道，“你在达抱岛上没有找到艾尔通，离开那里以后，怎么会想起要到东北一百英里以外的地方来的呢？”
“史密斯先生，”罗伯尔•格兰特回答说，“这不仅是为了来找艾尔通，而且还是为了找你和你的伙伴。”
“我和我的伙伴？”
“毫无疑问，你们是在林肯岛的。”
“在林肯岛？”吉丁•史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫十分诧异地一齐叫了起来。
“你怎么会知道有个林肯岛的呢？”赛勒斯•史密斯问道，“连航海地图上都没有它的位置。”
“我是看了你们留在达抱岛的那封信才知道的。”罗伯尔•格兰特说。
“一封信？”吉丁•史佩莱大声问道。
“一点也不错，信就在这儿，”罗伯尔•格兰特说，一面拿出一张标明林肯岛经纬度的纸条来，“这上面写着艾尔通和五个美国移民所在地。”
赛勒斯•史密斯看了以后，发现笔迹和畜栏里那张纸条上的一样，于是叫道：“是尼摩船长写的！”
“啊！”潘克洛夫说，“原来是他驾着我们的乘风破浪号，一个人冒险到达抱岛去的！”
“就为了去送这封信。”赫伯特补充道。
“怎么样，我没有说错，”水手大声说，“船长死了以后，还给我们尽了最后的一次义务。”
“朋友们！”赛勒斯•史密斯非常激动地说，“但愿仁慈的上帝怜悯我们的恩人尼摩船长的灵魂！”
赛勒斯•史密斯说到最后，居民们都摘下帽子来，喃喃地念着尼摩船长的名字。
然后艾尔通走到工程师身边，简单地说，“这只保险箱放到哪儿去呢？”
在荒岛下沉的时候，艾尔通冒着生命危险把这只保险箱保全下来了。现在他忠实地把它交给了工程师。
“艾尔通！艾尔通！”赛勒斯•史密斯深深地受到了感动，于是他对罗伯尔•格兰特说，“先生，你们抛弃的是一个罪犯，但是他经过忏悔，现在已经成了一个诚实的人。当我和他握手的时候，我感到骄傲。”
这时候，罗伯尔•格兰特才知道尼摩船长的奇异历史和林肯岛上的移民们的情况。船上的人观测了这片剩下来的浅滩；从今以后，就要把它标志在太平洋的地图上了。观测完毕，船长立刻下令启航。
半个月以后，移民们回到了美国大陆，他们发现，经过一场残酷的斗争，真理和正义获得了胜利，祖国又恢复了和平的环境。
林肯岛的移民们利用了尼摩船长留下的一箱财宝，把其中大部分用来在衣阿华州购买了一大片土地。在这些财宝里他们留下一颗最好的珍珠，用被邓肯号救回祖国的遇难者的名义送给了格里那凡夫人。
移民们在这块土地上从事劳动，也就是说，追求着富裕和幸福，创造一切他们曾经打算使林肯岛具备的良好条件。他们建立了一块广阔的聚居地，并且用沉没在太平洋里的荒岛的名字来给它命名。这里的一条河就叫做慈悲河，一座山就叫做富兰克林山，一个小湖就叫做格兰特湖，森林就成了远西森林。这里成了一个陆上的海岛。
在工程师和他的伙伴们智慧的双手下，一切都欣欣向荣起来。过去林肯岛的老居民一个也不缺，他们发誓要永远生活在一起。纳布和他的主人在一起，艾尔通随时准备为集体效劳，潘克洛夫当庄稼汉比过去当水手更加干得起劲，赫伯特在赛勒斯•史密斯的教养下，完成了他的学业，吉丁•史佩莱创办了《林肯岛先驱新报》，它成了世界上消息最灵通的报纸之一。
赛勒斯•史密斯和他的伙伴们那里，每隔一段时间就有客人来访问，其中有格里那凡爵士和他的夫人，约翰•盖格尔船长和他的夫人玛丽•格兰特，罗伯尔•格兰特和麦克那布斯少校，以及一切和格兰特船长、尼摩船长的一生有关的人。
总的来说，大家都很幸福，他们和过去一样紧密地团结在一起。但是，他们并没有忘记那个岛，他们一无所有地落在那里生活了四年，什么也不缺，现在那里只是一堆被太平洋波涛冲击着的花岗石；只是尼摩船长的坟墓。
